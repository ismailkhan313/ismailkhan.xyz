The Prophetic Household has become an exceptional instrument for the transmission of the character and personality of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ.

Allah ﷾ shows love to the Prophetic Household and shows its status to the believers.
> [!cite] Al-Ahzab (33:33)
> God wishes to keep uncleanness away from you, people of the [Prophet’s] House, and to purify you thoroughly.

The Prophet ﷺ loved his family members dearly and also wished his community to love them.

> [!cite] Ibn Abbas narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said:
> Love Allah for what He nourishes you with of His Blessings, love me due to the love of Allah, and love the people of my house due to love of me.
> 
> (Tirmidhi, al-Manaqib, 31/3789)

It is a commandment in the religion that we have love for the Prophetic Household.
