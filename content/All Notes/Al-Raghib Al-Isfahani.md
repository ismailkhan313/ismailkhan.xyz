#### Background
Abul-Qasim al-Hussein bin Mufaddal bin Muhammad, widely recognized as Raghib Isfahani, was an eminent Muslim scholar from the eleventh century. Born in Isfahan, Persia, his exact date of birth remains unknown. He lived during the Later Abbasid era and passed away in the year 502 AH, corresponding to 1108/1109 AD in the Gregorian calendar.
#### Scholarly Contributions
Raghib Isfahani was a distinguished scholar known primarily for his expertise in Qur'anic exegesis and the Arabic language. He authored several influential works, the most notable being **"Al-Mufradat fi Gharib al-Quran"** (Arabic: المفردات في غريب القرآن‎‎), a comprehensive dictionary focusing on the rare and difficult terms found in the Quran. This work is highly esteemed in the field of Arabic lexicography and remains a staple in many Islamic libraries worldwide.

Imam Al-Dhahabi, in his renowned biographical work "Siyaar A’laam Al-Nubala’," described him as:
> “The profound Allamah, outstanding Muhaqqiq, Abu Al-Qassim; Al-Hussein ibn Muhammad ibn Al-Mufaddal Al-Asbahani, known as Al-Raghib …”
#### Theological Stance
Raghib Isfahani's theological perspective aligned closely with the Ash'ari school. In his work **"al-I'tiqadat"**, he criticized both the Mu'tazila and the Shi'a sects, refuting their core beliefs. He particularly condemned the Shi'a doctrine of Imamah, which asserts the existence of twelve infallible Imams, and provided textual and logical evidence against the views of the Shia, Mu’tazilah, Jabriyyah, and Qadriyyah in his various writings.
#### Legacy
Raghib Isfahani's contributions to Islamic scholarship, particularly in Qur'anic exegesis and the Arabic language, have left a lasting impact. His works continue to be referenced and respected by scholars and students of Islamic studies. Despite the socio-political changes in the region, his legacy as a master of the Arabic language and a profound Islamic scholar endures.
