This note may prove particularly useful for dedicated readers interested in how this site publishes its notes.

This site is effectively a [personal knowledge base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_base) (PKB) on Islamic studies and technology based upon a private local [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault of the publisher. By utilizing the concept of [[Atomic Notes|atomic notes]] with [backlinking](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Backlinks) and [tagging](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Tags), when all else is working in cohesion, should provide deeper connections and quicker access to the broader concepts covered in this PKB. This thesis can only be proven through the test of time. Hence, at the outset of the project, notes may be completely incoherent or otherwise disjointed.

In considering what the 'definition of Islam' is or 'who is a Muslim', the site author aligns with the consensus of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah or mainstream Sunni Islam. A good formal insight into this can be gleaned from the principles and declarations outlined in [The Amman Message](https://ammanmessage.com/the-three-points-of-the-amman-message-v-2/) issued in the early 2000s by authoritative Islamic scholars from eighty-four countries.

Generally, this space avoids using transliteration whenever possible since the effort of the busywork involved doesnâ€™t justify the value, especially given the volume of notes inteded to be published over time. However, should transliteration be used on some selecte notes the [Brill Arabic-English transliteration system](https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/pages/help/transliteration-islam) will be used.

For Quran translations, [The Qur'an translated by M.A.S. Abdel Haleem](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-qur-an-9780199535958) is solely used. It is accessible and coherent, making it suitable for a wide audience. Sticking to a single, well-regarded translation helps maintain full consistency throughout the site.

All typefaces are sourced via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). The body font uses Lora, header fonts use Open Sans, and code fonts use IBM Plex Mono.
