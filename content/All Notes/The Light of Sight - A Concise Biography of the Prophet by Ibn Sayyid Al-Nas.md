Note: I read the translation by Ridawi Press which is freely available on their website. There is another translation available by Turath Publishing that is also worth picking as well.

Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ) said, “By Him in Whose Hands my life is, none of you will have faith till he loves me more than his father and his children.” (Sahih al-Bukhari 14)

The Prophet (ﷺ) said, “None of you will have faith till he loves me more than his father, his children and all mankind.” (Sahih al-Bukhari 15)

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized the importance of his esteemed position in a believer’s heart. He states the pinnacle of true belief is attained when he is cherished more than one’s kin, offspring, and the vast expanse of humanity. The nascent Muslims, with fervent devotion, took this teaching to heart, bequeathing it as a sacrosanct tenet and a religious ideal for a successful life in both the worldly and spiritual realms. Over time, a plethora of Prophetic biographical accounts, known as Seerah, were meticulously penned, illuminating the Prophet’s unparalleled character, his momentous life, his strategic encounters, and his diplomatic engagements with diverse civilizations, to name a few topics. The differing approaches to Seerah work go beyond chronicling historical accounts but serve as topical beacons of light to guide souls to the Prophetic reality. Likewise, the importance given to “The Light of Sight”, and others like it is to imbue the essence of Prophetic love past mere factual assimilation. It’s to delve into the heart of the matter: to know the Prophet intimately, thereby kindling an ardent love for him - peace be upon him.

Scholars like Ibn Sayyid Al-Nas, and his contemporaries, embarked on such noble endeavours to immerse the uninitiated into this Prophetic realm. The gradual immersion into Seerah work should as if by alchemy, transmute one’s heart, igniting an ever-deepening affection for the Prophet as one unravels his life and times. True affection is birthed from devoted understanding. Thus, the author, with conscientious precision, accentuates the more intimate facets of the Prophetic persona, drawing parallels to the communal connections we forge when we discern the nuances of those we hold dear. This short epistle is the author’s earnest attempt to distill the essence of this vast knowledge, presenting it succinctly for the budding student.

> The Messenger of God is an excellent model for those of you who put your hope in God and the Last Day and remember Him often. (Al-Ahzab, 33:21)

Almighty Allah underscores the significance of following the Prophetic Path as stated in the verse above. For God-conscious Muslims, it becomes imperative to perpetually seek knowledge about the Prophet. In acknowledgment of this reality, scholars have advocated for assemblies dedicated to his remembrance. Thus, being the concise biographical text that it is, “The Light of Sight”, is ideal for Mawlid gatherings, as it’s easy to read in short sessions. It offers a comprehensive view, from his miracles to his teachings, and is rooted in authentic sources, having been compiled by a respected 8th-century hadith imam, ensuring its credibility and authenticity.  
  
The author's full name was Abu'l Fath Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Yamuri al-Andalusi al-Misri, more commonly known as Ibn Sayyid al-Nas. He was named after his great-grandfather, Sayyidu'n Nas ibn Abu al-Walid. Born in Cairo in 671 AH (1272 CE), he was introduced to the Islamic sciences at a tender age, with aid from his father's prominence as a scholar. Ibn Sayyid al-Nas emerged as a luminary in various fields, including hadith, fiqh, Arabic grammar, accounting of biographies, and history. Scholars like Dhahabi lauded him for his insights, character, and generosity, while Shihabuddin Dimyati extolled his proficiency in the Prophetic biography (Seerah) and his command over the Arabic language. An intriguing episode from his life involves a gracious exchange with Imam Taqiyuddin Subki, which evidently led him to become the Head of the Hadith department at the Zahiriyyah Institute in Cairo. Tragically, he died suddenly in 734 AH (1333 CE) while resting in a masjid's prayer area (musallah). His legacy is cemented through his notable works that are still printed and taught today. He was laid to rest in the Qarafah cemetery next to the notable Hadith scholar, Ibn Abu Jamrah.  
  
From the works of Ibn Sayyid al-Nas is “Uyun al-Athar fi Funun al-Maghazi wa'sh Shamayil wa's Siyar.” It's an extensive biography compiled by the author, serving as a rich resource in Seerah work. Recognizing the need for a more concise version that is easier to reference, read, and transport, he penned this abridged edition. The purpose of which is to educate newcomers and serve as a review prompt for teachers. It's titled "The Light of Sight – A Concise Biography of the Trustworthy, the Divinely Protected (Nur al-Uyun fi Talkhis Sirat al-Amin al-Ma'mun)."
