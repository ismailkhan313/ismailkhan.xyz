And thus, He is: Necessarily existent, Pre-eternal, and Sempiternal, His Entity is dissimilar to all created beings and is therefore neither a body nor an accident. He is not characterised by place, time, being right, left, behind, or in front. He is Self-subsistent (qā'im bi-l-nafs, قائِم بِالنَّفس), One in His essence, attributes, and acts.

He is Living, Omniscient of all things past, that which will be, and that which will not come to pass. He wills everything that happens, that which manifests itself in the worlds, and that which has not manifested in them. He is Omnipotent over all possible things and their annihilation; no one shares with Him in that. He hears and sees all that exists. He speaks with an eternal speech that is free from sounds and letters.

**[Pertaining to Prophethood - Nubuwwāt, نُبُوَّات]**

Thus, they do not contravene Allah with regards to His commands and prohibitions; and likewise, the angels. It is necessary for Messengers — prayers and salutations be upon them — to convey to creation that which they have been commanded to convey from rulings and other matters...
