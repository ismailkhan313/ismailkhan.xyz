In matters of theology it is important to get an understanding the name of Allah when learning about the matters pertaining to Allah (Ilahiyyat). Understand the actual name of 'Allah' and the discussion surrounding what name the Supreme Name entails is an important matter in *ilm at-tawhid* which the Sufis are highly engaged in. 

There are various definitions for the Divine name 'Allah.' Many scholars hold the opinion that the name 'Allah' is the greatest and supreme name of all the Names of Allah. 

The name 'Allah' is often stated to be non-derivative and unique, with debates among scholars regarding its origin. The soundest position is that the Divine Name 'Allah' is not derived from a root word. 'Allah' is a name that shares no meaning with any other name, whether literally or metaphorically. 

> [!cite] *Tuhfa al-Murid*, Al-Bajuri:
> [Allah is] a proper name for a Being Whose existence is necessary and is deserving of all praise.

> [!cite] *Al-Maqasid al-Asna*, Al-Ghazali:
> Allah is the Name for the true existent, the one who unites the attributes of divinity, is subject of the attributes of lordship, and unique in true existence. For no existent thing other than Him may claim to exist of itself, but rather it gains existence from Him: it is perishing insofar as it exists of itself, and exists insofar as it faces Him... It is most likely that in indicating this meaning [Allah] is analogous to a proper name, so everything which has been said about its derivation and definition is arbitrary and artificial. This name is the greatest of the Ninety-nine Names, for it points to the Entity that gathers all of the Divine Attributes, unlike the other Names. It is the most specific of the Divine Names; hence it cannot be applied to others besides Him, Most High, neither literally nor figuratively.

> [!cite] Sharh Asma Allah Al-Husna, Ahmad Zarruq
> What distinguishes this name from the other names of Allah a is that it is said to incorporate the meanings of all the other names and is thus comprehensive in signifying the Divine essence and attributes in all their types.

> [!cite] *Sharh al-Mawaqif,* Al-‘Adud al-Iji
> [Allah] is a Name specific for His Entity. No others can be described with it—that is to say, it cannot be applied to anyone besides Him in the first place. It is said that the Name Allah is a definite and non-derivative [‘alam jamid] noun that is not taken from a root word. This is one of the two views of Khalil and Sibawayhi, and also related from Aba Hanifa, al-Shaf’, al-Khattabi, and al-Ghazali—may Allah be pleased with them. It is also said to be derivative, coming from the word ilab, with the hamza omitted due to its heaviness, and with a merging of the [double enunciation] of the letter lam. The correct position is that the expression “Allah”—assuming that it was originally an attribute [sifa]—has become a proper noun that signifies the divine attributes of perfection.
