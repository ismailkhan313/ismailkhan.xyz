### Rational Ruling (Hukm ‘Aqli)

A rational ruling (hukm ‘aqli) is a type of ruling that requires no empirical observation to affirm or negate its truth. It encompasses self-evident or axiomatic truths that stand independently from contingent normative rulings. Such rulings are established through pure reason and logic. For instance, rational possibilities can only be deemed necessary or impossible based on contingently normative observations. A statement like "I am in Croatia" is rationally possible, but it becomes absurd if normative observation confirms that you are actually sitting in front of me in Toronto. This example illustrates how rational rulings operate in the realm of abstract logic, while their contextual application is guided by empirical verification.

### Three Types of Rational Rulings

Rational rulings (hukm 'aqli) can be classified into three distinct types based on their logical nature: 
1. Necessary (wajib).
2. Possible (ja'iz).
3. Impossible (mustahil).

Necessary (wajib) refers to propositions that do not admit negation; these statements must always be true. 

Possible (ja'iz) accepts both negation and affirmation, meaning that such propositions can be either true or false depending on the context. 

Impossible (mustahil) refers to propositions that do not admit affirmation; these statements must always be false. 

This classification helps in understanding and categorizing statements based on their logical coherence and necessity.

### Rational Rulings for the Prophets
You must know about the Prophets the necessary, possible, and impossible. Especially in the attributes of:
1. Clarity.
2. Certitude.
3. Navigation through Revelation.
### Note on Causality

Anything that is observed does not necessarily make the observation true. Meaning, observing something occur to something else is not the basis of causality.

Ultimate causality is by Allah. There is no ability or power in anything other than Allah's placing of things. 

In that sense, much of what is observed to be true is not all what it seems to be. 

One may not be able to witness the relationship of two things, and also one may be able to witness the relationship of two things. However, this does not necessarily mean you can understand its cause. 

For example: 'does a knife cut?' There are three rulings to it: 
- The legal (shariah) ruling is that it is permissible to cut with a knife. 
- The normative ruling is that "we all observe that knives cut, therefore yes knives cut. 
- The rational ruling is that it is possible that a knife cuts.
