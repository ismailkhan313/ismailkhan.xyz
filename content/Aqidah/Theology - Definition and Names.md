The Arabic language primarily uses the term aqidah to broadly define the science of Islamic theology. Aqidah constitutes the core tenets of Islamic faith, such as the oneness of God (tawhid), prophets, scriptures, angels, the Day of Judgment, and divine predestination (qadar). These beliefs are fundamental and usually universal across the Islamic traditions. Aqidah is taught at the foundational level of Islamic education to ensure understanding of these basic tenets. An example of a creedal text is the popular [[Creedal Points of Aqidah Tahawiyyah|Aqidah Tahawiyyah]] of Imam al-Tahawi. 

Linguistically, *aqidah* means: to tighten, strengthen, and to tie. Aqidah comes from the root word aqd which has the opposite meaning of untying (*hal*).

Technically, *aqidah* means: the science which religious doctrine is determined by bringing forth irrefutable proof and expelling uncertainty. (Sharh al-Mawaqif, al-Jurjani. 1:40)

> [!cite] Ibrahims al-Marighni's *Tali al-Bushra* states:
> It is the science which researches Islamic creed that has been extrapolated from ireffutable evidence.

Some of its other names are: 
1. The Greatest Understanding (*Al-Fiqh al-Akbar*)
2. The Science of Monotheism (*Ilm al-Tawhid*)
3. The Foundations of Religion (*Usul al-Din*)
4. The Science of Evidences and Proofs (*Ilm al-Dalil wal-Burhan*)
5. Scholastic Theology (*Ilm al-Kalam*)

### Kalam

Kalam or *ilm al-kalam* is the science that establishes and elaborates upon matters of doctrine and belief. It is the sub-science of defending the soundness of the positions of Ahlus Sunnah to deviant sects. If refutes doubts and attacks against Ahlus Sunnah. It is the science devoted to the defence of the creed through rational arguments and refuting contrary beliefs. Thus, these scholars are professional debaters or polemics.  upheld by deviant sects.

Linguistically, kalam means "speech." "At first, the term was used by pious believers in contempt of those who relied on logic and philosophy to give a rational explanation of their faith. Eventually, it came to mean scholastic theology." [(A Commentary on the Creed of Islam, Evans & Elder, p. xiv)]

Ilm al-kalam is referred to as Islamic scholastic theology because it seeks to defend and rationalize Islamic beliefs using logical and philosophical argumentation. It involves a deep examination of theological questions and the use of reason to understand and articulate the faith. It utilizes a dialectical method of reasoning and debate to address theological questions and to refute heresies and misconceptions.

Ilm al-kalam tackles advanced, complex, and nuanced theological issues found in broader belief topics such as the nature of God, free will versus predestination, the attributes of God, and so on. 

Historically, ilm al-kalam represents an intellectual tradition that has developed over centuries, especially within Sunni Islam, with prominent schools like the Ash’ari and Maturidi. 

There is a difference of opinion regarding why it is employed as a name for the science of theology. Imam al-Taftazani mentions some reasons:

> [!cite] al-Taftazāni's *Sharh al-Aqaid al-Nasafiyya* states:
> 
> 1. Because of the problem related to the speech [kalām] of God and the creation of the Qur'an, which became one of the most renowned of its issues, the most strongly disputed, and the subject of the most controversy.
> 
> 2. Because the subject of its investigations was their saying: "The discourse [kalam] about such-and-such.”
> 
> 3. Because of the ability it imparts in verbal debate and in compelling one's adversaries to submit.
> 
> 4. Because the theologians chose to speak about issues that the early generations chose to refrain from engaging.
> 
> 5. Because it is the most disputatious and controversial of the sciences, so speech was greatly needed for conversing with those of the opposite view and for refuting them.
