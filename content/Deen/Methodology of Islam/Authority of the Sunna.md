## 3 hallmarks of authority of the sunna
The authority of the Sunna is established through three key hallmarks. 
 
First, it possesses undeniable proof, as it is well-supported by authentic and verified traditions. 
 
Second, the Sunna carries undeniable authority, serving as a fundamental source of guidance and legislation for Muslims alongside the Quran. 
 
Third, the Sunna is truly preserved, meticulously documented through rigorous chains of narration by scholars to ensure its authenticity and integrity. These hallmarks collectively reaffirm the Sunna's essential role in shaping and guiding the lives of believers.

## 4 proofs establishing authority of the sunna
The Quran establishes the authority of the Sunna through several key proofs. 

First, it makes guidance conditional upon following the Sunna, as emphasized in the verse, "If you follow him, you will be guided." 

Second, the Quran issues both general and specific directives that underscore the importance of the Sunna, such as the command, "Whatever the Messenger gives you, take it!" 

Third, the preservation of the Quran inherently involves the preservation of the Sunna through the rigorous system of isnad (chain of narration). 

Lastly, even though there were differences among the Sahaba (companions of the Prophet) and subsequent generations, leading to the creation of various sects, there is profound wisdom in the fact that all Muslims, regardless of their differences in opinion, ideology, perspective, or group, agree upon one Quran and the same corpus of material constituting the Sunna. 

This consensus highlights the enduring and unifying authority of the Sunna in the Islamic tradition.
