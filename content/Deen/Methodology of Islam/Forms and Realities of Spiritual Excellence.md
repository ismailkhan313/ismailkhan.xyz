## Forms, Realities, Responsibilities of Ihsan

### Knowing God through Closeness
The first core principle highlights that knowing God is achieved by seeking closeness to Him. This closeness is fostered by actively beholding God in all of one's actions and striving to maintain an awareness of His presence in every moment. When believers integrate this perspective into their daily lives, they develop a deeper, more intimate understanding of the divine.

### Mastering Ihsan through Tasawwuf
The second principle emphasizes the importance of ihsan (spiritual excellence) and identifies tasawwuf (Islamic mysticism or Sufism) as the science dedicated to mastering this excellence. Ihsan involves worshiping God as if one can see Him, and understanding tasawwuf provides the tools and practices necessary to cultivate this heightened state of spirituality and devotion.

### Perfecting Iman
The third principle involves the perfection of iman (faith), which means mastering all its qualities. Perfecting faith requires comprehensive knowledge and implementation of the tenets of belief, reinforcing trust, conviction, and love for God. This thorough understanding and practice of faith lead to a state of unwavering belief and spiritual maturity.

### Perfecting Islam
The fourth principle pertains to the perfection of islam (submission), which entails sincere adherence to its obligations and implications. Perfecting submission involves not only following the prescribed religious duties but doing so with genuine sincerity and commitment. This approach ensures that one's practice of Islam is complete and encompasses both the internal and external aspects of the faith.

### Purposeful and Conscious Actions
Lastly, the fifth principle stresses the importance of purposeful and conscious actions, underpinning the concept that one's rewards are tied to their intentions. This principle is rooted in the hadith that states actions are judged by their intentions, underscoring the necessity of being mindful and deliberate in one's actions. By ensuring that all deeds are performed with clear and sincere intentions, believers align their behaviors with divine expectations and attain greater spiritual rewards.

## The Form and Reality of Praying

Praying in Islam is both a form and a reality. The form is the structured action, a set of rituals and movements prescribed by the Prophet Muhammad and transmitted through generations. However, the reality of praying goes beyond these physical acts; it embodies the purpose and essence of turning to God. This dual nature of prayer signifies that while one follows the prescribed actions emulating the Prophet, the deeper significance lies in the perfect human way of seeking divine connection. It's not merely about performing the rituals but also about walking the spiritual path and striving to reach the ultimate destination of closeness to God. The form provides the structure, but the reality imbues it with profound meaning and spiritual fulfillment.

## The Foremost (Mukarrabun)

The Foremost, or *Mukarrabun*, are those who are drawn closest to God, their nearness accepted due to their profound sincerity. These individuals worship God as though they can see Him, epitomizing the highest level of spiritual devotion and awareness. They are the masters of spiritual excellence (*ihsan*), achieving superior levels of faith and practice through their sincere and pure intentions. The *Mukarrabun* fulfill all the meanings of sincerity to God, encompassing both their actions and inner states, making them exemplary models of devout worship and spiritual attainment. Their lives and worship reflect the ultimate realization of drawing near to God in every possible way.

The foremost (*mukarrabun*) are thus mention in the Quran (56:10-11):

> And those in front––ahead indeed! For these will be the ones brought nearest to God

### Responsibility: Attaining Spiritual Excellence

While achieving spiritual excellence is a noble goal, it is not an obligation. The actual responsibility lies in striving towards this ideal, rather than in attaining it. 

A saying from the Sufi masters goes, *'No one is obligated to attain success; their obligation is to strive.'* This means that the emphasis is on the effort and sincere intention to grow spiritually, rather than on the ultimate success in reaching spiritual perfection. The journey itself, marked by continuous striving and sincere effort, holds greater importance and value in the eyes of God. Therefore, one does not have to succeed in attaining spiritual excellence, but one must remain committed to the pursuit and effort towards it.

### Striving for Spiritual Excellence: A Divine Journey

Striving for spiritual excellence remains crucial, even when one perceives their faults as insurmountable and the reality of excellence as distant. For those who are not among the foremost in faith, God values their sincere actions, recognizing that everyone is in a state of progression towards spiritual excellence. As believers continue their journey, God draws them closer through their earnest endeavors. Ultimately, the journey is about God drawing near to the individual, rather than the individual reaching divine closeness by their own efforts. 

Seeking God is itself an act initiated by God, granted to us when He wills. The Quran (40:60) supports this with the verse: 

> Your Lord says, ‘Call on Me and I will answer you; those who are too proud to serve Me will enter Hell humiliated.’

The main takeaway is, *'Call upon Me and I will answer you.'* Thus, if one seeks God, it is a sign that God is seeking them to seek Him. Therefore, believers should place their hope not in themselves, their deeds, or anyone else but in God alone. No matter how daunting the spiritual journey may seem, the responsibility is to take the next step, trusting that the true destination is guided by divine support, and understanding that it is the faithful pursuit, rather than the final attainment, that holds true value.

## Avoiding Self-Limitation in the Pursuit of Spiritual Excellence
A primary caution for those who claim they will never be among the foremost is to avoid selling themselves short due to perceived faults and using these as grounds for assuming it's impossible to attain excellence. In reality, human beings are incapable of achieving anything on their own; there is no ability or power except by God's will. As such, one cannot fully know their capabilities until the end result is reached because God can bestow the necessary power and ability at any point during one's pursuit. Therefore, limiting oneself based on personal shortcomings fails to recognize the boundless assistance that God can provide along the spiritual journey.

## Excesses in Pursuing Spiritual Excellence

Muslims may encounter two significant excesses in their pursuit of spiritual excellence. The first excess involves thinking that Islam is solely about commands and prohibitions, thereby reducing the faith to a strict adherence to rules without understanding the spiritual and ethical dimensions behind them. This view may lead to a rigid and legalistic practice that overlooks the importance of inner devotion and spiritual growth. The second excess entails perceiving Islam as merely emotive feelings and a personal relationship with God, potentially neglecting the structured aspects of worship and the community obligations that are integral to Islamic practice. This perspective may result in a subjective and individualistic approach that lacks the balance of disciplined practice and communal responsibility. Achieving spiritual excellence requires harmonizing adherence to Islamic laws with a deep, heartfelt connection to God, ensuring a holistic and balanced approach to faith.

### Spirituality in Islam

Spirituality in Islam is defined as a living, sound relationship with God that infuses life into the religion. Without spirituality, Islam would be akin to a mere dead body propped upright without a beating heart, unable to sustain itself genuinely. A lifeless Islam, devoid of its spiritual essence, becomes merely a set of rituals and rules, losing its vibrancy and inherent beauty. By its nature, all dead things are repulsive, lacking the warmth and vitality that characterize true religious practice. Therefore, spirituality is crucial as it animates the faith, making it dynamic, heartfelt, and deeply meaningful.
