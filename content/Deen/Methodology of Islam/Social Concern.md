In the hadith of nasiha stated in [[Religion is Sincere Concern#Hadith religion is sincere concern]] social concern is understood as, *'and to the leaders of the Muslims and their common folk.'* Social concern applies to these two categories of believers. 

## Understanding social concern
Social concern within the framework of *nasiha* applies to both the leaders of the Muslims and the common person. Sincere concern and advice should be extended to all members of the Muslim community. For the leaders, it involves supporting and guiding them in their roles, ensuring they govern with justice and integrity. For the common person, it means fostering a sense of solidarity, empathy, and mutual care. By addressing the needs and well-being of both leaders and ordinary individuals, social concern helps to create a cohesive and compassionate community.

## Levels of social concern

The two levels of social concern encompass both the:

1. Communal dimension.
2. Social dimension.

On the communal level, social concern addresses the larger framework of political, social, and intellectual powers and authorities, including thought leaders such as artists and trend makers. This broad perspective requires a commitment to five fundamental principles: truth, peace, justice, mercy, and the overall good. The communal concern must focus on two main objectives: preserving good and preventing harm, ensuring that the society as a whole aligns with these core values. 

On the more intimate social level, social concern pertains to personal and community relations by upholding good character in all interactions. This involves demonstrating empathy, respect, and integrity in everyday dealings. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) exemplified this by often sitting in silence, listening to understand the needs of the society, and contemplating ways to make the community everlasting and superior. By addressing both communal and social levels, a comprehensive approach to social concern can be achieved, fostering a just and compassionate society.

## Essence of caring in religion

Caring in religion transcends the simple tallying of deeds; it fundamentally hinges on the depth of one's concern and sincerity. Rather than the quantity of religious acts, it is the genuine care and heartfelt intention behind them that truly matters. This idea emphasizes that caring must come with tangible proof, manifesting in sincere actions and a compassionate demeanor. 

The Shadhili master Sidi Ahmed Zarruq delves deep into this concept in his extensive 100-page book on the hadith of *nasiha* and spiritual concern, highlighting how true religious commitment is measured not by outward actions alone but by the genuine care and concern one holds for the faith, its teachings, and the well-being of others.

## What does it mean to have care for God?

Caring for God fundamentally means nurturing one's faith with intention and consistency. Just as the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) advised to keep one's relations "moist," suggesting that relationships need constant attention and care, the same principle applies to one's relationship with God. Like a plant that requires frequent watering to remain vibrant and alive, our spiritual connection with God demands ongoing effort, devotion, and reflection. By continually cultivating this relationship, we ensure that our faith remains strong and resilient, reflecting a sincere and enduring care for the divine.

## Meanings that nurture faith

Nurturing faith involves embodying five fundamental meanings: 

1. Love. 
2. Reverence.
3. Certainty. 
4. Gratitude
5. Action. 

These elements are essential in fostering a deep and resilient spiritual life. To nurture care for the Quran, one must develop a relationship with it through these five meanings, allowing its teachings to permeate and guide daily life. Similarly, nurturing care for the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) involves being certain in his traditions and feeling a sincere urge to act on his example. This means not only understanding his teachings but also striving to embody his character and actions in one's own life. By integrating love, reverence, certainty, gratitude, and action into all aspects of faith, one can cultivate a profound and enduring connection with both God and the guiding principles of Islam.
