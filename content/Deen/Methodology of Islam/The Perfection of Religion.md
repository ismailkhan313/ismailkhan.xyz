## Ihsan in relation to religion 

Spiritual excellence, or *ihsan*, is regarded as the pinnacle and ultimate goal of religion (deen). This concept is illustrated in the hadith of Jibril, where *ihsan* is defined as worshiping God as though you behold Him, and if you are unable to see Him, to know that He sees you. *Ihsan* encapsulates an elevated state of faith where one's actions and worship are performed with the utmost sincerity and awareness of God's presence. It represents the highest level of devotion in Islam, urging believers to cultivate a deep, conscious, and continuous connection with the divine in every aspect of their lives. This pursuit of *ihsan* transforms not just how believers worship, but also how they live, instilling a profound sense of closeness to God that permeates their daily actions and intentions.

## 4 lessons of ihsan 

There are 4 lessons of *ihsan* in relation to religion: 

1. It is the purpose, reality, and perfection of religion.
2. It is the realization of God's nearness. 
3. Excellence is completing and perfecting spiritual excellence in one's faith (*iman*) and one's submission (*islam*).
4. Perfection of religion manifests beauty and meaning that fulfills one's purpose in religion.

*Ihsan* represents the very purpose, reality, and perfection of religion (*deen*). It is the ultimate goal that believers strive towards, embodying the highest expression of faith and devotion. *Ihsan* goes beyond mere outward compliance with religious obligations and delves into the inner dimensions of a sincere and perfected bond with God.

One of the core lessons of *ihsan* is the realization of God’s nearness. To practice *ihsan* is to live with the constant awareness that God is always close, observing and engaging with His creation. This acute consciousness of divine presence transforms ordinary acts into meaningful expressions of worship, making *ihsan* an integral aspect of one’s spiritual journey.

Excellence in deen, achieved through *ihsan*, entails the completion and perfection of one’s faith (*iman*) and submission (*islam*). It calls for a higher standard of spiritual and moral conduct, where believers perform their religious duties with utmost devotion and sincerity. By integrating *ihsan* into their lives, believers perfect both their inner faith and outer actions, aligning them more closely with divine expectations.

Practicing *ihsan* brings forth the beauty and deeper meaning of religion, fulfilling one's purpose in *deen*. When believers achieve spiritual excellence, their lives reflect the harmonious blend of faith, worship, and morality, which epitomizes the true essence of Islam. This manifestation of *ihsan* not only enriches personal spirituality but also radiates outwardly, inspiring others and enhancing communal harmony. Thus, *ihsan* fulfills the purpose of religion by creating a life imbued with divine beauty and profound significance.
