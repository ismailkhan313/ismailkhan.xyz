## The nature of Transcendence (tanzih)

Transcendence, in the context of Islamic theology, refers to the absolute greatness of Allah. It emphasizes that there is no comparison between Allah and anything else in existence.

### Principle of the transcendence (tanzih)

The central principle of God's transcendence is that everything other than God is needy, dependent, created, and limited, bound by time and space. This principle underscores the fundamental difference between the Creator and His creation, highlighting God's self-sufficiency and limitless nature.

[[Methodology of Interpretation#Divine wisdom for allowing differences in speech|Divine wisdom for allowing differences in speech]] (Surah Ali Imran 3:7) mentions that the basis of Islamic belief rests on the decisive verses of the Quran. These verses provide clear and unequivocal guidance on matters of faith, including the attributes of God. Consequently, it is essential to interpret the non-decisive, ambiguous verses in light of these clear, decisive ones, ensuring a coherent and consistent understanding of the divine.

### Four aspects for decisive verses of belief

Decisive verses of belief in the Quran affirm four key aspects:
1. Clarity on Divinity: They provide unmistakable insights into the nature of God.
2. Affirmation of Divine Attributes: They confirm specific attributes that belong exclusively to God.
3. Absolute Negation of Similitude: They assert that nothing is comparable to God.
4. Clear Transcendence (Tanzih): They emphasize the absolute greatness and incomparability of God.

**Examples of Decisive Verses for the Attributes of God**

One example of a decisive verse includes Surah Ikhlaas (112:4), which clearly and decisively affirms God's attribute of incomparability: 

> There is none comparable to Him.

Another example is Quran 42:11: 

> There is absolutely nothing like Him, and He is the Seeing, the Hearing.

This verse equally affirms God's absolute uniqueness and negation of similitude. These verses succinctly encapsulate the concept of tanzih, reinforcing the understanding that God's attributes are unparalleled and wholly unique.
