## Expressing social concern 

Expressing one's spirituality effectively involves focusing on four key aspects:
1. Spiritual goals.
2. Spiritual routine.
3. Cultivate sincerity.
4. Attentiveness.

First, having a spiritual goal is essential, encapsulated in the wisdom that *'only a fool would put more emphasis on the perishing than the everlasting.'* This highlights the importance of prioritizing eternal values over temporal concerns. Second, establishing a spiritual routine, such as regular Quran recitation and other forms of remembrance, helps to maintain a consistent and meaningful connection with the divine. Third, cultivating sincerity is crucial, as God values a heart that genuinely seeks Him. Lastly, being attentive to the state of one's heart ensures that one's emotions and intentions are aligned with their spiritual aspirations. By integrating these four aspects—spiritual goals, routines, sincerity, and attentiveness—into daily life, one can achieve a more profound and authentic expression of their faith.

## Matters to consider when expressing social concern

When expressing social concern, it is important to consider four critical aspects to ensure meaningful and effective actions: 

1. Be active not just generic.
2. Give one's time.
3. Actively work with others of shared concern. 
4. Prioritize with purpose.

First, be active rather than generic; this means doing things with intent, purpose, and a sincere heart, focusing on the specific issues or individuals at hand. 

Second, give one's time generously, akin to paying zakat with one's time. This involves dedicating at least 2.5% of one's time, roughly four hours a week, to benefit society and leaving aside activities that do not contribute to the common good. Every limb and faculty should contribute to charity each day. 

Third, actively work with others who share similar concerns, as collaborating with a group can amplify impact and provide mutual support, preventing the sense of being overwhelmed that can come from working in isolation. 

Lastly, prioritize actions with a clear purpose, striving to serve in areas that offer the greatest, widest, and most enduring benefits. As encapsulated by the saying, *'What is entailed by intelligence is to choose what is most important,'* it is crucial to focus efforts where they will make the most significant difference. 

By integrating these four considerations—being active, giving time, collaborating with others, and prioritizing purpose—social concern can be more effectively and compassionately expressed.
