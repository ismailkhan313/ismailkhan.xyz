## Realizing Nearness of God

Realizing the Nearness of God involves an awareness and acknowledgment that God is continually "with" (ma'a) those who possess faithful qualities. This understanding is rooted in the frequent affirmation in the Quran that God is always near or with believers who embody these virtues. The realization that God’s presence is constant is itself a profound awareness, but maintaining this realization consistently is a mark of true greatness. 

The frequent mention of His Names in the Quran, all pointing to the singular divine essence of Allah, serves as a reminder of this closeness. To further internalize this realization, one should strive to make every action in life an offering to God. 

This means recognizing that every act has the potential to be dedicated to Him and beginning such actions with the invocation of the Basmala ("In the name of Allah"). By embedding this mindfulness in daily life, believers can continually foster a profound sense of God's nearness.

## 3 meanings for mindfulness with the basmala

The 3 meanings to highlight include: 

1. Remembering God.
2. Assistance of God.
3. Seeking God.

Mindfulness with the Basmala embodies three profound meanings. Firstly, it signifies remembering God, whereby one shows gratitude through conscious remembrance of His presence and blessings. This act of gratitude keeps the believer anchored in the awareness of God’s continuous grace. Secondly, invoking the Basmala seeks the assistance of God in every action undertaken. By beginning with "In the name of Allah," a believer acknowledges their reliance on divine support and guidance, ensuring that their efforts align with God’s will. Lastly, it denotes seeking God in every act, cultivating a mindful state of being conscious of God’s presence and purpose within it. This means doing each action with the intention of pleasing God, thereby infusing everyday activities with spiritual significance and devotion.
