## 3 main paths of belief

There are three main paths of belief in Islam: 
1. Revelation,
2. Reason, and 
3. Realization. 

The path of Revelation involves affirming what is decisively affirmed in the Quran and Hadith, grounding one's faith in the divine messages that have been revealed to humanity. The path of Reason emphasizes clarity, proof, defense, and refutation, utilizing intellectual and rational arguments to understand, support, and protect the tenets of faith. Lastly, the path of Realization is about transforming knowledge into personal experience and beholding, allowing individuals to internalize and deeply connect with their beliefs. Together, these three paths—Revelation, Reason, and Realization—can each lead a person to a profound and enduring faith.

## Root cause where reason leads to error

A root cause where reason leads to error is the *general tendency for people not to think well*, resulting in flawed reasoning and conclusions. 

Since most individuals are not adept at critical thinking, their reasoning often leads them astray. Additionally, no matter how deeply the mind contemplates, it will never fully solve the existential question, "What has God created me for?" This is because human reasoning alone is insufficient to grasp the divine purpose behind creation. Revelation provides the clarity needed to understand one's purpose, while reason aids in deepening that understanding. Therefore, reason must be complemented by revelation to avoid errors and achieve a true comprehension of one's existence.

## The outcome of realization 

The outcome of realization is to be in a state of certain faith and profound love for God. It is a spiritual journey where the realities of God unveil themselves to the believer, creating a deeper, more intimate connection. Those who have true faith experience a more intense love for God compared to those who do not. This journey of realization progresses through different levels of certainty: Ilmul Yaqeen (knowledge of certainty), which leads to Aynul Yaqeen (vision of certainty), and ultimately to Qalbul Yaqeen (heart of certainty). Each subsequent level represents a higher and more profound form of realization. By nurturing one's faith, a believer ascends through these stages, reaching greater heights of spiritual understanding and connection with the divine.
