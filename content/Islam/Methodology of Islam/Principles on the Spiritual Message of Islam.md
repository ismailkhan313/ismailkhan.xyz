## 5 Principles: The Spiritual Message of Islam 

There are 5 key principles:

1. Knowing God is done be seeking closeness to Him, a result of beholding God in all acts. 
2. Beholding God comes from mastering spiritual excellence (*ihsan*), and Islamic spirituality (*tasawwuf*) is its corresponding religious science.
2. Perfecting faith (*iman*) is to master all its qualities.
3. Perfecting submission (*islam*) is to be sincere and adhere to all its implications.
4. One must have purposeful, conscious actions as one is only rewarded by their intentions.
### Knowing God through Closeness

One core principle that emerges is that knowing God is achieved by seeking closeness to Him. This closeness results from beholding God in all acts, recognizing His presence and influence in every aspect of life. Such awareness transforms mundane actions into acts of worship, fostering a deeper relationship with the Divine.

### Ihsan and Tasawwuf: Path to Beholding God

Another principle is that beholding God comes from mastering ihsan, which translates to excellence in worship and actions. Tasawwuf, or Islamic mysticism, is the dedicated science of ihsan. By studying and practicing tasawwuf, believers cultivate a heightened sense of God’s presence, thus mastering the art of spiritual excellence.

### Perfecting Faith

Perfecting iman involves mastering all its qualities, which include belief in the unseen, the Prophets, the divine books, and the hereafter. This comprehensive understanding and internalization of faith’s attributes fortify one’s spiritual foundation, leading to a more profound and steadfast belief system.

### Perfecting Submission

Likewise, perfecting Islam requires sincere adherence to all its implications. This means not only fulfilling the obligatory rituals but also embodying the spirit of submission in every action. It involves a heartfelt commitment to God’s commands, ensuring that actions align with divine will and sharia.

### Purposeful and Conscious Actions

The final principle is that actions must be purposeful and conscious, as one is rewarded according to their intentions. This underscores the importance of niyyah (intention) in all endeavors. By setting clear, sincere intentions, believers ensure that their actions carry spiritual significance and are rewarded by God.

Together, these principles form a holistic understanding of the path to divine proximity, encompassing knowledge of God, spiritual excellence, comprehensive faith, sincere submission, and intentional actions.
