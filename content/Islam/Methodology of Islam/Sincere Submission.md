## The key Quranic call to Muslims

The key Quranic call to Muslims is to submit to God in sincerity and to ensure that this submission is carried out with sincere devotion. This dual emphasis on both the act of submission and the quality of sincerity underscores the importance of genuine faithfulness in fulfilling religious obligations. The Quranic teachings encourage believers to align their hearts and actions with the will of God, striving to meet His expectations with pure intentions.

## Definition of sincerity

Sincerity, or ikhlaas, is a quality of the heart that encompasses various other noble qualities. It involves a heartfelt dedication and purity of intention in all actions and thoughts directed towards God. Sincerity integrates attributes such as love, gratitude, hope, fear, and having a good opinion of God. These qualities collectively ensure that one's devotion is genuine and free from any ulterior motives. Moreover, this sincerity extends beyond personal worship to include a sincere concern for God's creation, demonstrating care and compassion in one's interactions with others. This holistic approach to sincerity enriches the believer's spiritual life and fosters a deeper connection with God and His creation.

## Verse on seeking sincerity to God 

The pursuit of sincerity to God is beautifully outlined in Quran 33:21: 

> The Messenger of God is an excellent model for those of you who put your hope in God and the Last Day and remember Him often.

This verse highlights the Prophet Muhammad as the supreme model of ethical conduct and spirituality, whose life provides a template for achieving sincerity. God Himself has vouched for the Prophet’s exemplary character, elevating his code of ethics above all others. True sincerity (ikhlaas) stems from adopting ethics (akhlaq), which in turn is cultivated by following the Prophetic Example. This process is essential to attaining God-consciousness (taqwa). To emulate the Prophet is to align oneself with the will of God, as God has endorsed the Prophet's conduct and teachings. Therefore, prioritizing the Prophet’s example over all others is fundamental for anyone seeking sincere devotion to God.
