## What is the Path?

The Path involves turning one's entire being—heart, soul, mind, and body—solely towards God. The essence of one's actions lies in the heart's resolution to perform them; without this internal commitment, actions are mere lifeless forms that will turn to dust on the Day of Judgment. The Path encompasses the how, what, and where of turning to God, ensuring that every aspect of one's existence is aligned with divine purpose and direction.

## Requirements to Spiritually Turn to God

The 4 requirements to spiritually turn to God are: 

1. Aim.
2. Resolve.
3. Path.
4. Method

To spiritually turn to God, the first requirement is to have a clear aim: to desire God, seek His closeness, love, and eternal pleasure. As stated at the end of Surah Kahf, "Whoever longs for the meeting of their Lord, let them perform actions that are virtuous." This highlights the importance of setting one's ultimate goal on attaining nearness to God through righteous deeds.

The second requirement is resolve, which involves striving in all things—both crucial and mundane—towards the aim of divine closeness. This determination transforms intentions into actions, ensuring that every endeavor is aligned with the pursuit of God.

The third requirement is to establish a path that operationalizes and brings the aim to a practical basis. This means devising a way to enact one's resolve, ensuring that daily actions reflect the continuous effort to turn towards God.

Finally, to stay on this path consistently, one must adhere to a method that aligns with the goal of divine closeness. This method provides the framework and details for the path, enabling one to maintain their spiritual journey while remaining true to their initial aim. By following these requirements, one ensures a comprehensive approach to turning spiritually towards God.
