The series "How Islam Works" examines the critical scholarly approach to understanding Islam as an organized dogmatic religion. It explores how mainstream Islamic scholars have meticulously preserved the Qur’an, the Sunna, and authoritative scholarly interpretations from the Prophet's time to the present. These notes highlight the historical and scholarly dedication that has safeguarded the primary Islamic texts and teachings from the start of the religion.

A hadith states: 

> It has been narrated on the authority of Jabir b. 'Abdullah who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: A group of people from my Umma will continue to fight In defence of truth and remain triumphant until the Day of Judgment. (Sahih Bukhari, Sahih Muslim)

The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ foretold that a group of his followers would always preserve and uphold his teachings, remaining *"unharmed by anyone who opposes them until the Day of Judgment."*

This series aims to give readers a foundational understanding of the preservation of Islamic teachings. Readers will explore how the Qur’an and Sunna have been preserved through history, identify key elements of the scholarly tradition in mainstream Islam, understand how this tradition has consistently safeguarded these teachings, and learn to apply the principles of the Qur’an and Sunna in contemporary times.
