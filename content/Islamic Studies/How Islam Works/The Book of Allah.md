This note emphasizes the need for mankind to receive Revelation from the Creator.
### God's Merciful Self-Designation
 
God sent Revelation to creation due to His *self-designation* as a merciful entity for His creation. Revelation serves as a profound expression of His mercy, providing essential guidance for humanity. Importantly, through His Will, Revelation is a mercy for our guidance because God _chose_ to be merciful to creation.

### The Quest for Meaning

This essential guidance addresses fundamental existential questions such as: Why are we here? What is our purpose? How did we come into existence? And what happens when our lives end? 

These are the inquiries that shape our quest for meaning, yet without Revelation, we remain lost in a sea of speculative answers, none of which fulfill our deeper longing for purpose. 

### Questions of Reality, Duty, and Meaning

Only through the Creator's wisdom and Revelation can we find satisfying answers to these existential questions. In the relationship between Creator and creation, it is imperative for the Creator to provide these answers, as the creation lacks the capacity to define its purpose independently. This is the core reason for Revelation’s existence.

Revelation also addresses essential questions of reality, duty, and meaning: What is truly happening in our lives? What are we supposed to be doing? How should we understand our actions and roles within the larger context of existence? 

### Intrinsic Human Needs for Guidance

These questions reflect intrinsic human needs, which are universally contemplated. Revelation provides clear answers, directing humanity towards a deep-seated need for guidance. It points us towards the Siratul Mustaqeem, the straight path that signifies a universal concept attainable by all humans. This path, offered through divine mercy, guides us towards fulfilling the purpose of our lives, striving for salvation and a coherent understanding of our existence.

### Three Major Themes of the Quran

The Quran encompasses three major themes that form the core of its message to humanity. 

Firstly, it extensively tells us about Allah, describing His attributes, His unique oneness, and His role as the Creator and Sustainer of the universe. These verses establish the foundation for understanding who Allah is and foster a relationship of worship and obedience towards Him. 

Secondly, the Quran emphasizes the concept of consequence, highlighting the outcomes of human actions both in this world and in the Hereafter. This theme underscores the importance of accountability, where righteous deeds lead to divine reward and sinful actions result in punishment. 

Lastly, the Quran provides profound guidance, offering a clear path to follow for those seeking to live a life of righteousness and obedience to Allah. It contrasts this guidance with non-guidance, illustrating the pitfalls and consequences of straying from divine directives. Together, these three themes—knowledge of Allah, consequence, and guidance—create a comprehensive framework for understanding the purpose of life and the means to achieve spiritual success.
