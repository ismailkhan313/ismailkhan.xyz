## The reason for the sunna

*I simple question may arise: Why do we need the Sunnah when we have the Quran?*

We need the Sunna in addition to the Quran because the Sunna represents the way followed by the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), who serves as the initial contact between mankind and God's Speech. The Prophet is not only the Messenger who conveyed the Quran but also the standard and embodiment of its teachings. His life, actions, and sayings provide the only practical example of how to implement the Quranic principles in everyday life, ensuring that the divine guidance is fully understood and correctly applied. Thus, the Sunna complements the Quran by offering a living illustration of its commands and values.

Surah Al-Imran (3:164) states:

> Indeed, Allah has done the believers a great favor by raising a messenger from among themâ€”reciting to them His revelations, purifying them, and teaching them the Book and wisdom. For indeed, they had previously been clearly astray.

This verse highlights the immense blessing bestowed upon the believers by Allah, who sent Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) as a messenger from their own community. The Prophet's role was not just to convey the Revelation of God, purify the hearts of the believers, and impart knowledge of the Quran and wisdom. Through his guidance, the believers were led away from misguidance and towards a path of righteousness and enlightenment.

## 4 purposes of the sunna

From Surah Al-Imran (3:164) above, we can derive four key purposes for the Sunna. 

First, it involves reciting Allah's verses, which brings divine guidance to people and illuminates their paths. 

Second, it serves the purpose of purifying the believers. This guidance entails the process of _tazkiyyah_, which is the removal of anything that hinders one from remembering God, necessitating proper instruction before one can soundly perform such purification. 

Third, the Sunna includes teaching the Book, the Quran, which is the primary source of all ultimate good and the main means of achieving righteousness. 

Fourth, it involves teaching wisdom, which shows individuals how to apply the teachings of the Book. This wisdom was crucial because, prior to it, humanity was in manifest misguidance. 

The Sunna, therefore, functions as a comprehensive guide that not only conveys the divine message but also instructs on how to purify oneself, understand the Quran, and apply its teachings wisely.

## Goals and means of a Messenger

The primary goals of bringing a Messenger are to: (1) recite Allah's verses to the people and to (2) purify them, guiding them towards righteousness and spiritual cleanliness. 

To achieve these goals, two key means are employed: (1) teaching the Book, which is the Quran, and (2) imparting Wisdom. 

Teaching the Book ensures that the divine message is clearly communicated and understood, serving as the foundation for all ultimate good. Imparting wisdom, on the other hand, equips individuals with the knowledge and insight needed to apply the teachings of the Quran effectively in their lives, thereby transforming theory into practice. Together, these goals and means establish a comprehensive framework for spiritual and moral guidance.
