The concept of "مُضاف" (mudāf) and "مُضاف إِلَيْهِ" (mudāf ilayhi) pertains to a possessive or genitive construction, where one noun is in construct with another. 

The "مُضاف" (mudāf) is the possessed noun. The "مُضاف إِلَيْهِ" (mudāf ilayhi) is the possessor noun.

Here are some quick rules for the mudāf and mudāf ilayhi construction:

1. There is posessive relationship. The construction usually indicates possession or association. The mudāf ilahyi is the possessor noun that takes possession of the mudāf is possessed noun.
2. The definiteness of the entire construct (mudāf + mudāf ilayhi) is determined by the mudāf ilayhi. If the mudāf ilayhi is definite, the whole construct is definite.

Mudāf
1. Always the first term in the construction. 
2. Never takes a definite article "الـ". It remains indefinite in form even though the whole phrase might be definite.
3. Does not take tanween.
4. Always precedes the mudāf ilayhi. It comes first. 

Mudāf ilayhi
1. A mudāf can have multiple mudāf ilayhi, forming a string of posessions, e.g., "مَفَاتِيحُ بَيْتِ الرَّجُلِ" (mafātīḥu bayt al-rajuli) means "the keys of the man's house."
2. Always ends in the genetive case, that is majrur (مجرور).
3. It can be definite, it can have "الـ".
4. It can accept tanween.
