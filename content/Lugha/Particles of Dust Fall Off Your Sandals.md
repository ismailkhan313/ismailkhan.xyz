> Particles of dust fall off your sandals <br>
> They become the crowns on the heads of the moving stars
> 
> As he blesses thieves like us with his generosity <br>
> The load on the back transforms in to golden robes
> 
> The doorstep of my master is that upon which <br>
> Grazed are the foreheads of leaders
> 
> My Eisa, may I be sacrificed on you <br>
> Wrongdoings are the doings of the ill
> 
> O Criminals keep your eyes smiling in hope <br>
> Burning coal become flowers in this court
> 
> O Criminals keep your eyes smiling in hope <br>
> Burning coal become flowers in this court
> 
> Lives and hearts they sacrificed at your feet <br>
> How fortunate is the fate of your friends
> 
> In honesty, fairness, generosity and courage <br>
> These four are famous in all four corners (of the world)
> 
> For saluting Ali in the battlefield <br>
> The heads of the swords remain bowing
> 
> A servant of such masters am I Raza <br>
> Respect and honor of my masters flies high!
