In the grand mosaic of Islamic tradition, one practice stands out for its enduring appeal and profound significance: the tradition of praising Prophet Muhammad ﷺ **through poetry**. This practice, deeply rooted in the history and hearts of Muslims, is illuminated by the actions of the Prophet's companions. Their involvement in this art form offers a historical precedent that remains as relevant today as it was centuries ago. Esteemed for their close association and understanding of the Prophet's teachings, their engagement in poetic praise sets a benchmark within the Islamic tradition, highlighting the permissibility and commendability of this expression.

_Compositions of the Companions: Poetry in Praise of the Magnificent Messenger_ ﷺ translated by Moustafa Elqabbany for The Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre  (RISSC) is a deeply reverent collection of poetry, celebrating the life and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ from his own companions. Drawn primarily from the esteemed works of Imam Ibn Sayyid al-Nās, namely _Minaḥ al-Madā_, this short anthology stands out for its authenticity and historical significance, solely featuring verses recited by the Prophet's ﷺ companions in his presence.

Notably, all translations, except for the celebrated Ka‘b ibn Zuhayr’s _Mantle Ode_, are original contributions to this volume, offering readers a fresh perspective on these time-honored compositions. The inclusion of Suzanne Stetkevych's translation of the _Mantle Ode_ further enriches the collection, providing a link between contemporary scholarship and traditional Islamic literature.

What makes this translation noteworthy is its careful balancing act between preserving the original Arabic verse's essence and making it accessible to a wider audience through idiomatic English translations. While these translations are not literal, they succeed in capturing the spirit and depth of the original Prophetic-era poetry, making the work both a literary and spiritual journey.

The poetry composed by the companions of the Prophet ﷺ provides a direct window into the thoughts, emotions, and experiences of those who lived alongside him. This historical context offers an authentic perspective on the Prophet's ﷺ life, character, and teachings, which is invaluable for both scholars and followers of Islam.
