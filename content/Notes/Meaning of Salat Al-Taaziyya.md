From the prescribed daily awrad of Shaykh Faisal. This note for the [[Salat Al-Taaziyya]] holds its general acceptance and meanings passed down from the scholars and sages. This Salawat formula is primarily one of tawassul whereby the individual reciting it turns to Allah via the Messenger ﷺ. Consequently, the recitation of the formula is encouraged.

Durood Nariya or Salat al-Nariya (Arabic: صلاة النارية; the Fiery Prayer), also known as Salat al-Tafrijiyya (Arabic: صلاة التفريجية; the Prayer of Relief) was transmitted by Imam al-Qurtubi ﵁. It is also known as Salat al-Taaziyya (Arabic: صلاة التازية) because of it’s association with Shaykh Abd al-Wahhab al-Tazi ﵀. This all-encompassing salutation upon the Prophet ﷺ is well-known in the Muslim world for alleviating difficulties and averting tribulations.

Al-Nariyyah comes from the Arabic word, nar, which means fire. It is thus named as it causes the one reciting it, to obtain his objectives as swiftly as fire burns. Al-Tafrijiyyah translates as bringing relief as the said formula is tested to bring relief to the one reciting it. Al-Qurtubiyyah comes from the great scholar, Imam al-Qurtubi. Al-Nazili in his *Khazinah al-Asrar* ascribes the method of reciting this formula to Imam al-Qurtubi. The method encourages at a time of difficulty and challenges, that a group of brothers gather and recite the formula 4444 times. This will then bring a swift relief from those challenges and difficulties.

Other names of the formula include al-Kamilaha, al-Nuraniyyah, and al-Taziyah. The latter is the name I have taken from my Shaykh. 

Salat al-Nariya is also referred to as Salat al-Taziyya due to its association with the great Shaykh and gnostic [[Abdul Wahhab al-Tazi]] (d. 1206 AH/1792 CE), a native of Fez, Morocco. Shaykh Abdul Wahhab al-Tazi was the student of the erudite [Shaykh Abd al-Aziz al-Dabbagh](https://islamicmap.com/abdul-aziz-dabbagh/) (d. 1132 AH/1719 CE) and later became the teacher of the [Shaykh Ahmad ibn Idris al-Fasi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_ibn_Idris_al-Fasi) (d. 1253/1837).

> [!cite] Yusuf al-Nabahani, *The Muhammadan Litanies*:
> 
>This prayer, called the Prayer of Relief (*al-Salat al-Taftijiyya*), was mentioned by the Shaykh and gnostic Muhammad Haqqi Effendi al-Nazili in *Khazinat al-asrar.* He quoted Imam al-Qurtubi who said:
>
>>Whoever reads this prayer 141 times or more regularly each day, Allah will relieve his distress and anxiety, alleviate his worries and problems, facilitate his needs, enlighten his innermost being, exalt his rank, improve his condition, expand his provision, open for him the doors of goodness and excellences with increase, grant him influence, make him safe from the vicissitudes of time and the evil afflictions of hunger and extreme poverty, and place love for him in the hearts of other people- and there is nothing he asks of Allah except that Allah will give it to him.
>>
>>These benefits, however, are not obtained unless one condition is met, namely that the prayer be read regularly. This prayer is one of Allah's treasures, and its invocation is a key to Allah's treasure stores. Allah grants an opening to those of His servants who read this prayer regularly, and by it He causes them to arrive at what He wills for them.
>
>Elsewhere in *Khazinat al-asrar.* Shaykh Muhammad Haqqi Effendi al-Nazili said:
>>And among the tried and tested prayers is the Prayer of Relief (*al-Salat al-Taftijiyya*) from al-Qurtubi. Those in the Maghreb call it the Fiery Prayer (*al-Salat al-Nariyya*), and that is because when they wish to obtain something that is sought after or avert something undesirable, they come together in a single gathering and read this prayer 4,444 times and quickly obtain what they were seeking.
>>
>>The people of mystical secrets call it the Key to the Encompassing Treasure for Obtaining the Servants' Wants (*Muftah al-Kanz al-Muhit li Nayl Murad al-'Abid*), and it is "O Allah, send a perfect prayer and complete greeting of peace upon our master Muhammad - the one by whom difficulties are alleviated, distresses are relieved, needs are fulfilled, and aspirations and good endings are attained, and by whose noble face rain-laden clouds are sought—and upon his Family and Companions, with every glance and every breath, by the number of everything that is known to You." I received a license for this prayer in this wording from Shaykh Muhammad al-Sanusi atop Mount Qubays [in Mecca], after which I received a licence for it from Shaykh al-Maghribi followed by Shaykh Sayyid Zayn b. Makki, may Allah be pleased with them all.
>>
>>Shaykh Muhammad al-Sanusi said, "Whosoever reads it regularly eleven times each day. then it is as if it [the prayer] sends down provision from the heavens and causes it to sprout from the earth."
>>
>>Imam al-Dinawuri said, "Whosoever reads this prayer eleven times after the end of each [obligatory] prayer and adopts it as his regular litany will never have his provision cut off and he will attain lofty degrees and a sanctuary of wealth. Whosoever reads it forty-one times regularly after the Dawn Prayer each day will also obtain his wants. Whosoever reads it one hundred times regularly will attain what he seeks after and more than he desired. Whosoever reads it regularly each day 313 times—the number of the Emissaries, upon whom be peace—for the unveiling of secrets, then he will behold everything that he wanted to see. Whosoever reads it regularly 1000 times daily will receive what cannot be described by those gifted at description—what no eye has ever seen, what no ear has ever heard, and what has never occurred to the heart of man."
