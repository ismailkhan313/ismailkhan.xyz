In 2024, I embarked on a significant reading challenge, starting the year by diving into over 25 foundational books on Islam. These books were thoughtfully recommended and curated by [QuranicThought.com](https://quranicthought.com/), an organization based in Amman, Jordan. This platform is a treasure trove of millions of Arabic Islamic manuscripts, with the broader aim of gathering every classical Arabic manuscript in the Islamic tradition and making it available online. They also provide supplementary notes and audio lectures, making the site an invaluable resource for students, researchers, scholars, and teachers. 

Their site states: “Our mission is to preserve Islamic Civilization by making all its jewels available to the whole world for free using the latest technology.” Furthermore, it states:

> Because the religious sciences produced by Islamic Civilization are so vast, we have categorized them by main subject to make access easier: e.g., Qur’an (for listening); _tafsir; hadith, usul, seerah, ‘aqidah, fiqh; ihsan, falsafa,_ and so on. We have chosen a list of 25 books for the essential texts of all disciplines which all Muslims should know. Beyond that, however, we have made a special section for the 500 most influential books on Sunni Thought (according to the Royal Aal al-Bayt Institution’s seminal survey). Most people—even many scholars—will not read much more than 500 books (especially as these are long books) in their lifetimes so this should suffice as a roadmap for most people to read throughout their lives.

The goal of this reading challenge is to read through a foundational corpus of authoritative Islamic thought and take notes. As time goes on, I intend to upload some edited versions of these notes for selected texts, just as a way to share my personal learning and as a reference for later use.
## Why This List?

1. Educational Value: Each book is a treasure trove of knowledge, offering insights into the history, culture, and beliefs of one of the world's largest religions.
2. Cultural Understanding: In a world where misconceptions about Islam are rampant, this challenge provides an authentic source of understanding and empathy.
3. Personal Growth: Engaging with these texts can be a transformative experience, offering spiritual, moral, and philosophical insights.
4. Traditional Perspectives: The selection includes works from various scholars, providing a well-rounded view of Islamic thought.
5. Historical Insights: Understanding the past is crucial to comprehending the present. These books offer historical context that is often missing in contemporary discussions about Islam.
The following [page](https://www.quranicthought.com/25-introductory-books/) outlines all 25 introductory texts on Islam. In reality, the list is greater than that if one considers that some texts are actually a series of numbered volumes, depending on which edition one reads. I will consider all volumes in a series to be included as an individual text. Some texts reads at over a thousand pages while other shorter treatises sit at under a hundred pages.
