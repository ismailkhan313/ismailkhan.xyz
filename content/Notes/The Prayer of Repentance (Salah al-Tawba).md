The Prayer of Repentance is also known by Salah al-Istighfar or Salah al-Tawba. 

Allah Most High says, “Turn towards Allah, O believers, every one of you, so that you may be successful.” [Quran, 24:31]

The best repentance is to resolve not to return to such matters, and to turn to Allah, expressing one’s remorse with one’s own heartfelt words.

The prayer of repentance for a transgression (ma'siyah) which a person commits.

Therefore, it is recommended to make this prayer when you make a mistake.

Sayyiduna Abu Bakr related from the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him and give him peace) that he said, “There is no one who commits a sin, goes and performs ritual ablutions, and then prays two rak‘as without being heedless after which they seek Allah’s forgiveness except that He forgives them.” [Abu Dawud]

After this, he (peace and blessings be upon him) recited Allah Most High’s words, “And those who, when they do an evil thing or wrong themselves, remember Allah and implore forgiveness for their sins – Who forgives sins save Allah only? – and will not knowingly repeat (the wrong) they did.” [Quran, 3:135]

This has been related by Abu Dawud and Tirmidhi in their respective Sunan, and the scholars declared it to be a recommended prayer. [Ibn Qudama, al-Mughni 1/348; Ibn Abidin, Radd al-Muhtar 2/28, quoting Sharh Shir‘at al-Islam via Shaykh Isma‘il al-Nabulsi]

For the Shadhili salah al-tawba has higher degrees of significance, as a practical means to purifying oneself constantly, as mentioned in [[Repentance (tawba)]].
