Kalaam written by Sayyidi Ala Hazrat Imam Ahmad Rida Khan (Allah is pleased with him), translated by Mufti Zahid Hussain al-Qadri

> [!poetry]
> Particles of dust fall off your sandals 
> They become the crowns on the heads of the moving stars
> 
> As he blesses thieves like us with his generosity 
> The load on the back transforms in to golden robes
> 
> The doorstep of my master is that upon which
> Grazed are the foreheads of leaders
> 
> My Eisa, may I be sacrificed on you 
> Wrongdoings are the doings of the ill
> 
> O Criminals keep your eyes smiling in hope
> Burning coal become flowers in this court
> 
> O Criminals keep your eyes smiling in hope
> Burning coal become flowers in this court
> 
> Lives and hearts they sacrificed at your feet 
> How fortunate is the fate of your friends
> 
> In honesty, fairness, generosity and courage 
> These four are famous in all four corners (of the world)
> 
> For saluting Ali in the battlefield 
> The heads of the swords remain bowing
> 
> A servant of such masters am I Raza
> Respect and honor of my masters flies high!
