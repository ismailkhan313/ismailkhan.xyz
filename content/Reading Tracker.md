Like many other avid readers and closet bibliophiles I created a Goodreads account in the early 2000s, and despite its lack of updates and now archaic tech stack, the site still serves me well. However, I've dug myself down into a dark rabbit hole of bookshelves with books I'm uncertain I'll ever read. At some point I tried to recall every single book I ever read down to my earliest memories of completing a book, and sure enough when I recalled a book and googled the title or searched up the book cover I did remember finishing it. From middle school reads to high school, and all the textbooks and supplementary texts of college and university, I added as many books I could think of. As of 2024, that lands me a a modest ~200 books read. So instead of purging my Goodreads shelves I'm compiling a little booklist here to track down on meta-genre of books no matter its actual genre: those books that actually provided real benefit and inward substance. These are the high impact, high resonance books.
