Suhba as-Saliheen (صحبة الصالحين) refers to the concept of companionship with the righteous. This practice is deeply rooted in the Sufi tradition and highlights the profound impact that good companionship can have on an individual's spiritual journey.

Suhba (صحبة) means companionship, association, or being in the company of. As-Saliheen (الصالحين) refers to the righteous, virtuous, or pious individuals.

Together, Suhba as-Saliheen emphasizes the importance of surrounding oneself with people who are righteous and virtuous to cultivate one's own spiritual and moral development.

> [!cite] The Prophet ﷺ said:
> A person will be on the religion (deen) of their close friends, so each of you should consider whom he befriends. (Sunan Abu Dawud, Jami' At-Tirmidhi)

This hadith was discussed in [[Reality of Religion#The Essence of Deen]]. And the [[Hadith of the Perfumer and the Blacksmith]] expands on this.

> In the path of Sufism, keeping the company of others (suhba) is of tremendous consequence in the journey to Allah, in accordance with the wont of Allah Most High and His wisdom. Some have even said, “Whoever has no sheikh [but travels the path alone] has the Devil as his sheikh.” Another has said, “A person is like a [fruit] tree growing up in the wild: if not trimmed and pruned, it becomes a scrub.” And Abul ‘Abbas al-Mursi has said, “Whoever has no sheikh in this matter is not to be rejoiced over” (Iqadh Al-Himam, 95–96).

> An important point raised by this is the matter of suhba or companionship with others to get closer to Allah. The path of ‘uzla or solitude is not the path of suluk or spiritual travel. One can only have spiritual travel by associating with others, listening, and following. This is why there is a tariqa, and why the tremendous emphasis on companionship. As our sheikh often says, “One’s nature takes from another’s, so choose for your company him who obeys.” Who, for example? After a few general guidelines, we are all free to choose:
> 
> (1) One should not take for one’s companions those who are irreligious and do not pray. If one has such friends, then if there is not some other aim countenanced by Sacred Law in keeping their company such as maintaining family ties, one should taper off one’s dealings with them in a gentle yet effective way, such as by acting bored until they go and find other friends. “It might be that you are doing badly,” says Ibn ‘Ata' Illah, “but keeping the company of someone even worse than you displays to you your merit.”
> 
> (2) One should have as many friends among practicing Muslims as one can, which Allah has made a sunna because we don’t know which of our believing friends will make intercession for us on Judgement Day. This is at the level of companionship and acquaintance.
> 
> (3) A third level is that of intimate friendship and love; and this should be reserved for those whom one wishes to absorb the state of. In the case of the spiritual traveller, this means those whose state is dhikr or remembrance of Allah, and one should seek out those who both are salik or ‘travelling’ and who motivate one to emulate them. It is at this level that Ibn ‘Ata' Illah says, “Do not keep the company of someone whose state does not uplift you or words guide you to Allah.”

Furthermore for the murid, the text *Adab al-Suhba* by Imam Abul-Mawahib 'Abd al-Wahhab al-Sha'rani is taught by their Shaykh. This text is divided into three sections. Section 1, "Being in Good Company," delves into the benefits of being in good company and highlights the rewards prepared for those who love each other for the sake of Allah. Section 2, "The Rights of Companions," discusses the adab (proper conduct) between brothers. Section 3, "Etiquettes of the People of Tasawwuf," explores the specific etiquettes and behaviours expected from those engaged in the practice of Sufism. 

> [!cite] *Adab al-Suhba*, Imam al-Sha'rani
> Know – may Allah give you success in what He loves – that the rights of companionship are many, however we will mention to you a set of rights that are essential in the path of conviviality and social company. Know also, that the Sheikhs have emphasized the care for the rights of the brothers, saying: 
> 
> “Anyone who neglects the right of his brothers, Allah the Exalted afflict will him with his rights being neglected, and when Allah afflicts a servant in that way, He abhors him, and when (Allah) abhors a servant He will throw him into the Fire.”
