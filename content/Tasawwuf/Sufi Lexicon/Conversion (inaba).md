> Conversion (inaba) is more particular than [[Repentance (tawba)]]. It means to return to God [with our pride] broken and with a renewed aspiration for the spiritual journey. There are three levels of conversion: turning from sin to repentance, turning from heedlessness to vigilance, and turning from separative consciousness (farq) to unitive consciousness in God (jam' 'ala Allah).
