## Definition and Causes
The passage highlights two aspects of miserliness: 
1. One related to the Sacred Law (Shariah) concerning rights owed to God and His creation, 
2. and the other associated with muru'a, 

Muru'a an Arabic concept denoting manliness and valor. Muru'a was a defining characteristic in pre-Islamic Arab culture, akin to Western ideals of chivalry and virtue. The Arabic root for muru'a is linked to the term for man, but it encompasses both manliness and humanity.

The first aspect of miserliness involves obligations under Sacred Law, specifically the requirement to pay Zakat, a form of charity for the needy, which must not be withheld. Similarly, there is an obligation to financially support one's wife and children, even after divorce. Not fulfilling these obligations of Sacred Law is considered the most severe form of miserliness.

Regarding valor, there is importance of not creating difficulties over trivial matters. Creditors should be flexible and generous rather than demanding, especially if they are financially secure while the debtor is struggling. A creditor who shows understanding and compassion is considered to possess valor. Although magnanimity is not a legal obligation since the creditor is entitled to repayment, being indifferent to the debtor's needs and insisting on payment is regarded as reprehensible.

Regarding Islamic ethics, wealthy perople should make important magnanimity, generosity, and leniency. A hadith recounts a wealthy man who instructed his servants to absolve debts if debtors couldn't pay. Upon his death, God forgave him for his forgiveness toward others. 

Hosts should avoid being overly critical, suggesting they should remain calm if guests accidentally damage something. Or, no haggling is recommended when purchasing funeral shrouds, as they serve as a reminder of mortality, or when buying livestock or goods for charity. These actions reflect humanity and valor.

There is importance of how we conduct ourselves when facing or fulfilling responsibilities. It suggests that causing unnecessary difficulties for others undermines their dignity, as noted by scholars. Similarly, fulfilling obligations or giving without goodwill is regrettable. When giving charity, it is crucial to do so with humility and kindness, recognizing it as a privilege and honor to help others and fulfill divine duties.

Giving in charity should not involve donating shoddy or inferior goods, as this reflects stinginess. The faith encourages giving from what one values and loves, as God blesses such charity and amplifies its benefits. The Quran advises believers to give from the good things they have earned and not to offer inferior items that they themselves would not accept without hesitation (2:267). It emphasizes that righteousness is achieved by giving of what one cherishes (3:92).
