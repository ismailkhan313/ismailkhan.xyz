The content structure of these notes will be based on the text, "A Commentary Upon the Creed of Imam Al-Dardir" by Imam al-Dardir, translated by Siddiq Adam Mitha. After I lay out study notes from this text, I will bolster it from my study notes from [[00 - Dardir’s Kharida al-Bahiyya]]. 

Bolster after from the following: 
-  [[00 - Ilish’s Taqrib al-Aqa’id - Quranic Foundations of Theology]]
- [[00 - Ghazali's Qawa'id al-Aqa'id - Understanding Beliefs, Proofs, and the Spiritual Cultivation of Faith]]
- [[01 - Introduction to Ushi’s Bad’ al-Amali]]

After, reassess which texts to add.
