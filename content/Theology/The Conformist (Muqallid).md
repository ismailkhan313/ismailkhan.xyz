The note [[Types of Evidence (Daleel)]] distinguishes the issue of the conformist (*muqallid*) as a matter of importance. 

## Definition 

In *Taqrib al-Aqa'id* it states:

> The conformist is someone who believes without proof in that which is necessary, possible, and impossible for Allah. He has made a sure judgment that is congruent with the truth, but it was without evidence.

A conformist, known as a *muqallid*, is someone in a state of *taqlid*. This individual holds sound and true beliefs, yet they arrive at these beliefs without personal evidence or independent inquiry. Instead, the *muqallid* reaches the truth through blind imitation, following the guidance and teachings of others without questioning or seeking evidence on their own.

The *Jawharat at-Tawhid* of Imam al-Laqqani states:

> Since anyone who imitates another in the belief in Oneness: His faith is not safe from doubt.

This is the majority opinion among the Ashari (and Maturidi) scholars, in that, someone in a state of taqlid, known as a muqallid, is indeed a believer, but they are seen as a sinner due to their lack of personal inquiry into their beliefs. 

There are, however, scholars from the Athari tradition who argue that a person practicing taqlid is not a true believer. 

The Ashari position is that while the *muqallid* holds faith (*iman*), they must repent sincerely (*tawbah*) and seek evidence of the Oneness of Allah to solidify their beliefs. This consideration pertains specifically to beliefs about Allah. 

The statement, *"His faith is not safe from doubt,"* can be interpreted in another way to suggest that the muqallid wavers between belief and disbelief. However, in this lesson, we emphasize the interpretation that a muqallid's faith is inherently not free from doubt (shek) due to their reliance on blind imitation.

## One Exception to the Concept of the Muqallid
There is one major exclusion when discussing the concept of the *muqallid*. 
Many Companions of the Prophet Muhammad simply witnessed him, were awestruck by his presence, and believed in him by virtue of his being a Prophet. 

They accepted everything he said without seeking further evidence, and thus are not considered *muqallids*. Their evidence was the prophetic presence and light emanating from the Prophet, which is regarded as the highest spiritual reality for mankind in the final age. 

People belonging to this group still exist today, and it is possible to be part of this group even now. Therefore, they are not included in the debate concerning the muqallid, as their faith is based on direct spiritual experience rather than blind imitation.

In Surah Az-Zukhraf (43:22) it states: 

> No indeed! They say, ‘We saw our fathers following this tradition; we are guided by their footsteps.’


The word أُمَّةٍۢ along with 'tradition' also mean 'religion' and 'creed'. 

The conformist’s Iman (faith) is not safe from doubt, as it shares a similarity with the disbelievers who also follow their beliefs without question. This is what the verse refers to, highlighting the inadequacy of blind imitation. People before Islam often believed by blindly following their forefathers, a practice not accepted in Islam because their belief was based on imitation rather than understanding. In contrast, Iman in Islam is reasoned faith, grounded in the teachings of the Quran. The polytheists, on the other hand, cling to their beliefs without critical thought or evidence, exemplifying the dangers of unexamined faith.
