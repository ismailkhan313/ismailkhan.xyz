*Rest thee awhile, cool thy visage, and replenish thy vessels.*

> Raise your words, not voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder. â€” Jalaluddin ar-Rumi

It's not the loudness but the wisdom in words that nurtures growthâ€”like rain, not thunder, brings flowers to life. Raising the quality of words and speaking with kindness and wisdom is far more effective than raising an aggressive voice. And so, true impact comes from thoughtfulness and compassion.

> I never saw any lamp shining more brilliantly than the lamp of silence. â€” Bayazid al-Bastami

In silence, we often find the brightest truthsâ€”it's the light that speaks when words cannot.

> The real journey is when the world's dimension is rolled away from you so that you see the Hereafter closer to you than yourself. â€” Ibn Ata'illah as-Sakandari

The spiritual journey is when the distractions of the material world fade away, allowing the Hereafter to become more immediate and real to you than even your own existence. It's about seeing past the illusions of life and realizing the eternal truth closer than your own self.

This small *online oasis* consolidates my notes on the Islamic tradition, a list of related [book reviews](https://ismailkhan.xyz/tags/book-review) in the [[Reading Tracker]], tech insights on software management, productivity, digital resource library building, and a variety of other connective thoughts. This space is a fix-up and a mixed bag, a cross between a digital garden and an personal index of the Islamic tradition built out from a previous time. And alas, the notion of an online oasis came to mind when first conceiving of this project, and what is before you is what is what it represents.
