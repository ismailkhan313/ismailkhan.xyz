*Rest thee awhile, cool thy visage, and replenish thy vessels.*

This small *online oasis* consolidates my notes on the Islamic tradition, a variety of related book reviews listed in the [[Reading Tracker]], technology insights in software management, productivity, digital resource library building, and other connective thoughts. It is a fix-up and a mixed bag; a cross between a digital garden and an Islamic tradition index built out from a previous time. And so, the metaphor of an online oasis came to mind when first conceiving of this project.

> Raise your words, not voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder. â€” Jalaluddin ar-Rumi

The pervasion of noise tops up our mental bandwidth and 'beneficial information signals' obscures and entropies. My belief is that, inwardly, this leads to a melancholic yearning for clarity and insight. The soft science behind 'information overload', 'cognitive biases', and the 'attention economy' all lends itself into the entrenchment of 'noise' we earn each day. At its root, thoughts are like seeds we plant in the fertile soil of our minds. Thoughts hold the extraordinary power to inspire, educate, and transform. Like gentle rain, words can nurture the delicate blossoms of ideas, fostering growth and enlightenment. By capturing these words into notes or through thoughtful dialogue we cultivate a garden of wisdom, where every petal reflects the light of understanding. In contrast, raising our voice in anger and angst is akin to the clap of thunderâ€”loud and attention-grabbing but ultimately fleeting and destructive. Thunder may command immediate attention, but it lacks the nurturing touch necessary for growth. Similarly, loud and aggressive communication often falls on deaf ears, creating barriers rather than bridges.

The post-modern world is a cacophony of 'noise' that drowns out reason. Claude Shannon's *'A Mathematical Theory of Communication'* (1948) demonstrates that with any communication channel the presence of noise can obscure the signal, leading to loss or distortion of the intended message. Irrelevant or extraneous data i.e., 'noise' can undermine the transmission of meaningful information. Then what of the unbeknownst individual in the maturity of the information age?
