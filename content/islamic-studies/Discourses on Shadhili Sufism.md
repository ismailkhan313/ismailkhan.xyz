# Dhikr and Mudhākarah
Dhikr and mudhākarah interrelate in Taṣawwuf. Dhikr is the formulaic recitation given by the Shaykh to the murid. Mudhākarah is the Sufi teaching taught by the Shaykh, in his presence, to the murid.

Dhikr and mudhākarah both lose value and purpose if not taught by a rightly guided Shaykh.

The subject of Sufism via mudhākarah has an:
1. outward semblance (rasm) and,
2. an inward reality (ḥaqīqah).
## Rasm and Haqīqah

The outward semblance (rasm) of Sufism is about: **you**. In that sense, Sufism is the science of yourself; the reaching of one’s fullest destiny. This is the practical component of the Sufi way in action.

Sufism does not touch you, meaning, it does not come from something outside of you, rather it _is_ you. You change yourself from _within_ not without.

The Shaykh is a guide that shows you yourself. He shows the door to you, and prepares you for what is beyond it. But it is up to you to take the journey and seek truth.

Therefore, the subject of purifying the self (tazkiyatul nafs) is a major focus in the outer aspect of tasawwuf.

The outer directly relates to to the Wird of the Murid they must do. And the Wird is connected to the Wārid or the blessings given by Allāh due to maintaining the Wird.

The ḥaqīqah of Sufism is about the: **Essence of Allāh Himself** (Idhatul Haqq). This is the true focus of Sufism. Its nature is metaphysical, abstract, and subtle. It directly relates to the Wārid given to the Murid by Allāh.

Wārid is the Nur of Allāh reaching you; the Oneness of Allāh manifesting in you; the spiritual gifts Allāh opens for you and in you, due to the sincerity of your Wird. The Wārid is connected to the Wird i.e., the outer aspect of Taṣawwuf.

There are multiple realities (ḥaqīqat) one can attain. Yet, **every single ḥaqīqah merges into the Ultimate Reality** (Ḥaqīqatul Haqqāiq)—Allāh.

Every reality (ḥaqīqah) is a reality because it entails _being_ something.

In this sense the definition of reality (ḥaqīqah) is:
- A reality is that which _is_ or a state of.
- Every reality is a singular state of being.
- To acquire a reality necessitates its realization and manifestation of it.
- Each reality has degrees of realization and manifestation.
The true reality of Taṣawwuf is to _be something_; in other words, to *be* with Allāh (SWT). As Allāh is the Ultimate Reality. Therefore, to *be* something in the truest sense of reality is to *be* with Allāh.

The ḥaqīqah of dhikr: to be something; in other words, to *be* with Allāh *in* the dhikr. The role of the Shaykh shows the murid how to be with Allāh until he attain multiple realities.

The ḥaqīqah of mudhākarah: it is a mirror for your self. A mirror allows you to look at yourself in a way you cannot look at yourself otherwise or by yourself. In other words, it is an outside tool to show you the inside of yourself that you cannot see by your own self. By looking at the mirror, you can see all the distortions. Then you can determine if the mirror is saying you are something, if you are anything at all.

Mudhākarah is a tool for reflection and change. Mudhākarah comes from the word *tubsirah* which means 'to wake up and change.' The mirror is showing you yourself and the work you need to do to yourself. Mudhākarah tells you what to change _from_ into what to change _into_.

You change by first identifying what is wrong within your own self, then you review yourself after taking what the Shaykh imparts upon you in the sessions of mudhākarah.
# The Sunnah

The Sunnah is the way of optimism and of rejoicing. Why? Because ‘the odds’ are always on the side of Allāh (SWT). He will always win. It is just a matter of time before Allāh says He will win and the losers will lose.

Therefore, maintain tawakkul in Allāh until that time comes. Do not be upset about anything, especially for the Sufi interested in their wārid. The Sufi should not concern nor dwell on the extent of the wārid given to him by Allāh.

Take care of the things that Allāh says for you to take care of. Namely, take care of your nafs, and get your nafs to Paradise.

# Why the Path if the Awwam are Saved?

Question: Why should the murid struggle on the spiritual Path if it suffices the believer to follow the general outlines of Islam to be saved? Especially if by following the general outlines the believer will still achieve endless bliss from it?

Answer: It is as Imam Jalāludīn Ar-Rūmī said,

> 'somebody who is given amnesty for his crimes is not like somebody who reaches a high place with the King.'

The Path is to reach the highest of degrees, so you can be accepted by the King and reach a high position with Him in His Court. This would not be the case for the person who is merely forgiven and accepted by Allāh, except by His leave.

# Maʿrifah 

## Defining Maʿrifah

From Imām Aḥmad Ibn ʿAjība *maʿrifah* is **'the knowledge of Allāh, directly and experientially.'** Furthermore, the Imām states it is, **'the consolidatedness of one’s beholding of the Divine (_Mushahadah_).'** This is not to say that one’s veil is lifted, and some of the Nur of Allāh is granted to you for a time. Rather, it means that *maʿrifah* becomes the predominant state, in that, it occupies most of one’s time.
## Maʿrifah and the ʿArif

According to the Imām, the knower of Allāh (*ʿarif*) is:
1. One whose *maʿrifah* predominates him in that his predominant state is perpetually beholding Allāh.
2. One who has good Adab with Allāh, inwardly and outwardly. He becomes like he worships Allāh as if seeing Him.
3. Holds a heart that is out of its mind with love for Allāh.
4. One who behold anything except his Master, and doesn’t turn to anyone besides his Master.

The paradise for the Sufi can begin now by reaching Allāh in this world through attainment of inner knowledge (*maʿrifah*). For the ʿarif, the paradise of the knowledge of Allāh (_jannatul ʿarif_) is entered first before entering actual paradise (_jannatul zakarif_).

Attaining *jannatul ʿarif* comes from prolonged dhikr, *mushahadah*, being with the One of Absolute Beauty, being with the Countenance of Allāh (_wajh_). *Mushahadah* is to actively witness Allāh in everything; a state of active wariness and presence of Allāh. In essence, attaining a constant state of *mushahadah* comes from spending all one's time striving to be with His Being. 

The Prophet (saw) said,
> 'watch carefully over Allāh [through obeying His commands and leaving His prohibitions] and you will find Him right in front of you.' (*ahfadila tajidutu tajadak*) ([Jami' at-Tirmidhi 2516](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2516)). 

In sum, someone who is with Allāh in this world is someone who has already entered Paradise.
## Maʿrifah and the Murid

The nature of the murid who has *maʿrifah* always asks of himself, 'How can I give thanks to Allāh as it befits the blessing He has put me in?'

Ibn ʿAṭā ʿIllāh As-Sakandarī said, 

> 'That which the ʿarifīn seek, when they ask for something from Allāh, Allāh will not put anything on their lips except because He wants to give it to them.' 

Note this is the case for ordinary Muslims as well.

## What do the ʿArifīn ask for?

Regarding this question Ibn ʿAṭā ʿIllāh said, 

> 'They want genuineness in expressing their slavehood to Allāh.'

Ruwaym Ibn Aḥmad said, 

> 'Gratitude to the Divine is spending everything you got for Allāh (_as-shukru istighfraha dhaka_).' 

In other words, every moment, breath, limbs, heart, desires, inmost secrets is for Allāh. 

Ruwaym Ibn Aḥmad was a companion (sahib) of Imām Junayd and a Shādhilī master in his own right. He also said, 

> 'And undertaking to discharge to Allāh what is due to Him.' 

Meaning, no one can claim they are everything Allāh is asking of them. Those who say they are do not understand what is going on, they are deluded.

To this effect the Prophet (saw) said, 

> 'There is no one who is more jealous (_ghirah_) than Allāh.' (Ṣaḥīḥ of Imām Al-Bukhārī; ma min ahadin aghi min Allāhi.)

## The Sufi is One Who Demands Everything

The Sufi is one who demands everything, in that, they want to reach Allāh in everything. The Sufi Path wants everything from Allāh, such as high stations, high rank, closeness to Allāh, and high spot in Jannah. Therefore, the price for this is to pay *everything* to Allāh.
# Hadith of Ibn ʿAbbās

The hadith of Ibn ʿAbbās: 'Watch Over Allāh And You Will Find Him In Front Of You.'

It is stated in a hadīth: 

> 'One day I was behind the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) [riding on the same mount] and he said:
> 
> “O young man, I shall teach you some words [of advice]: **Be mindful of Allah and Allah will protect you. Be mindful of Allah and you will find Him in front of you**. If you ask, then ask Allah [alone]; and if you seek help, then seek help from Allah [alone]. And know that if the nation were to gather together to benefit you with anything, they would not benefit you except with what Allah had already prescribed for you. And if they were to gather together to harm you with anything, they would not harm you except with what Allah had already prescribed against you. The pens have been lifted and the pages have dried.” It was related by at-Tirmidhi, who said it was a good and sound hadeeth. [Source](https://sunnah.com/nawawi40:19).

Another narration, other than that of Tirmidhi, reads:

> Be mindful of Allah, and you will find Him in front of you. Recognize and acknowledge Allah in times of ease and prosperity, and He will remember you in times of adversity. And know that what has passed you by [and you have failed to attain] was not going to befall you, and what has befallen you was not going to pass you by. And know that victory comes with patience, relief with affliction, and hardship with ease.

As for the text, '**Be mindful of Allah and Allah will protect you. Be mindful of Allah and you will find Him in front of you**,' it can also be understood as, 'watch Allāh carefully (the existence of Him and His Command) and He will watch you carefully (He will guard you from the implications of the existence of Allāh and He will take care of you).' If this is done well you will find Allāh in front of you. Meaning, the end of the path is to be face-to-face with Allāh, immediately in the divine presence. In essence, this is the Path of the Sufi. The assistance of which is followed up with, 'If you ask, then ask Allāh. And if you seek help, seek the help of Allāh.'

Imām Junayd said, 
> 'this spiritual Path is blocked.' 

There is no way to traverse the Sufi Path without first finding Allāh immediately in front of you, without an intermediary, experientially, with awareness of the rūḥ, because Allāh cannot be contained by His creation. The physical world is merely another slave of Allāh. It is absurd for Allāh to imbue or incarnate himself to one of His slaves. The eye of the rūḥ, the heart, the inmost secret (sirr) is the eye with which Allāh is beheld. The Path is blocked except for those who follow the traces of the Prophet (the Ḥadīth), and the practical translation of the Prophetic heritage (the Fiqh).

Imam Shibli said, 
> 'the Arifeen are asleep and the jahileen are dead.'

Again the ʿarif is the one who knows Allāh. They have a spiritual Path, and have a direct and experiential experience with Allāh. Whereas the jahil is the one who does not know Allāh. They have no spiritual Path, and thus they have no understanding. The arifeen are asleep in the sense that they are still alive but have not yet woken up to see true Reality in full, that is Allah. The jahileen are dead in the sense they are still alive in this world but dead in that they will not see true Reality.

The same concept is related in a hadith by the Prophet Muhammad (saw). Shaykh Faisal mentions this hadith in Ramaḍān Companion. The hadith reads to the effect of, “the parable of one who makes dhikr of Allāh and he does not make dhikr is the semblance of the living with the semblance of the dead.”
# Worship Allāh As If You See Him

The aim is to worship Allah as if you see Him as is widely cited in one of the foundational hadith of the religion - Hadith Jibreel. The faculty with which this is done is the spirit (rūḥ) and the inner insight (basirah).

**The inner insight (basirah) is, 'that faculty or insight that can see the beginninglessly eternal.'** It can see the before creation and after creation equally. Contrastingly, the physical eyesight can only see what originates in time (haddath). Why? Because of the nur that the basirah can perceive gives its truth. 

Allāh was and nothing beside, after the manifestation of the Divine (source: Sahih Bukhari). Allāh is One and unique and this manifests (tajalli) truth for the arif. After the manifestation of the Divine by the encompassing of the arif, the light of the divine presence comes into the arif. Allāh loves this slave and thus this arif operates as if they see Allāh. In that they’re limbs and faculty operate as if Allāh is in front of them, as does their heart and mind. In other words La hawla walaquwatta ila biLah (there is no motion/power except by Allāh). This results in Fana fil afal: the annihilation in the actions of Allāh. Meaning the chirping of the birds all become signs from Allāh, as all action from the creation of Allāh is by Allāh. The basis and origin of anything that begins in time is the beginninglessly eternal. All motion and power, and all manifestations return to the one who manifests it and he who by through it is manifest.

# The Rūḥ Was Created To Know

The Rūḥ was created to know and it can know many things. 

The rūḥ is not veiled by the flow of time as conventionally understood flowing from the past into the future. The rūḥ experiences time from the future into the past. This is why sometimes you have a hunch that something is going to happen, and you had no previous idea about it before, then you find it in front of you. Why? This is the nature of the rūḥ. This is how the rūḥ has been created, and for this to happen all the time is Supreme Intellect. The only obstacle that prevents the rūḥ from acting like this all the time is due to the limitations of the physical body, the ego, desires, waswasa and Shaytan. Fully being in the flow of your rūḥ is the Supreme Intellect because the rūḥ is only attached to the light of Allāh. Why? Because this is the design of the rūḥ. It was made in Paradise, nearest to the court of Allāh, in all it’s light and splendour. That is where its homeland is and thus gives of that very nature in you at times.

# Tasawwuf Is About You 

Tasawwuf is about you and *not the awliya*.

This science is fundamentally about your personal spiritual journey rather than focusing on the previous travails of the saints (awliya). Should your goal is to attain spiritual authority (wilaya), you should not be concerned with the identities or locations of the spiritual pole (qutb) or the spiritual deputies (abdaal). 

A sign that a spiritual fratenity (tariqa) is deteriorating is when it becomes preoccupied only with spiritual recitations (awrad) and lore about the saint (wali), while neglecting essential aspects of tasawwuf such as etiquette (adab), service (khidmah), and nurturing (tarbiyyah). 

To truly engage with tasawwuf, you must be fully present in the moment (waqt). Obsessing over the whereabouts of the qutb and the abdaal, or similar elements of Sufi lore, distracts one from the attainment of their own wilayah. 

The reality is that: you have one foot in the grave. Thus, it is crucial to equip yourself with as much spiritual benefit as possible before you face it.

Imam Ibn Ajiba said:

> Know that this knowledge we speak is not attained by the prattling of the tongue. It’s nothing besides direct experiences and ecstasy. It cannot be taken from papers but only from people who posses those experiences. It cannot be reached by gossip, but only by the service of its men and keeping the company of the perfected. By Allāh, no one who has succeeded has succeeded except by keeping the company of someone who has succeeded.

Similarly, proper adab and subha as-saliheen are pillars in the Sufi Path and thus your spiritual journeying.

# The Path is Rough and Smooth

Some parts of the spiritual Path are challenging, while others are smooth. As a seeker (murid), you must adapt to the fact that you are operating on Allah’s time, not your own. The Path does not follow your personal schedule but rather Allah’s timing. This is important in controlling your intellect (ʿaql). 

The intellect (ʿaql) is a 'valuable servant but a terrible master.' Early on, you must avoid letting your ego and intellect dominate you. Those with intellect may initially feel they are progressing well because of their intellectual abilities, but true advancement comes from overcoming this reliance and continuing on the Path with proper etiquette (adab). With proper adab then the murid's inherent intellect will become beneficial in their spiritual progress. 

As you travel, you cannot control the Path itself, but you can manage your manners when faced with both rough and smooth parts. The Path is fundamentally about manners (adab), and the spiritual path (tariqa) emphasizes adab throughout the journey.

# The First Adab When Looking For A Tariqa

Those looking for a tariqa should be wary of (fiqh) ulema telling people there are no Sufi ulema in the world present today. For those ulema to say that means they have not met a true Sufi Shaykh before, and they find it far-fetched for anyone else to have met one as a result. 

In a hadith Qudsi, Allah said on the tongue of the Prophet Muhammad (saw),

> 'I am as my servant thinks of me.' (Sahih Bukhari)

Meaning, that if someone believes that Allah’s doors are closed to them, they should first consider whether they have shut the door on themselves. If they think there is no hope of achieving Ihsan, the fault lies with them for not seeking it, not with Allah. Such individuals have closed the doors on themselves due to their low opinion of themselves, even though the Bestower of gifts—Allah—remains unchanging and ever-ready to bestow His blessings. 

Allah has not gone anywhere; His hands are outspread, ready to give generously.

# 'The Spiritual Path is Gone and So Are its People'

Abu Bakr Al-Wasiti said, 
> 'the Spiritual Path has hone and so have its people. And nothing remains excepts regrets.'

Abu Bakr Al-Wasiti was one of the principal students of Imam Junayd. 

Although this statement, while not accurate at face value, carries a deeper meaning. Three points can be taken here: 
1. Pretenders exist in the stead of a true Shaykh.
2. There are dangers that arise out of the principles (usul) of the Path.
3. Keeping oneself complacent in their states in comparison to previous generations.

Firstly, he highlighted the presence of charlatans who claim to be true Shaykhs, to the point that: not everyone who professes to be a Shaykh or to lead a tariqa is genuine. The true measure of a Shaykh or a tariqa lies in their conformance to the Shariah. 

Secondly, the Imam warned of the dangers inherent in the principles (usul) of the Path. 

Thirdly, some seekers fall into complacency, especially when they compare their own spiritual states to those of earlier, more esteemed generations. By making this statement, the Imam underscores the discrepancy between their own level of spirituality and that of the Tabiyeen and Sahaba, emphasizing the futility of such comparisons. 

Whatever exceeds these three purposes is nothing more than the whisperings (waswasa) of Shaytan. 

Note this point relates to the first adab in looking for a tariqa as mentioned previously. 

# Second Adab When Looking For A Tariqa

- Must take the Path from a guide and not from a book from a bookstore
- You have to take a murshid, who
    - Inspires him with his state
    - Directs him to Allāh with his words
- Shaykh al-Akbar says, “Whoever does not take the tariqa from one of its men, only goes from one absurdity to another.”
- Hikam at-Tirmidhi mentions, “People have been prevented from attainment by nothing but rushing down the Path without a guide gobbling up nothing but their desires and taking dispensations and making symbolic interpretations.”
- Whoever treads the Path of Sufism without a Shaykh, then Shaytan is their Shaykh
    - Includes people who buy books on Sufism and claim it suffices them
    - There is no such thing as DIY Sufism
- Knowledge can only be taken from those who possess knowledge. Sufism can only be taken from those who possess Sufism

# Avoid The Dangers Of Spiritual Ostentation

- Abdur Raham ibn Majhdhub said, “Bury your secret in the Earth 70 fathoms down and leave all men in doubt about you until the Resurrection Day.”
	- He was one of the Shaykhs in the Shadhili Silsila

# The Secret Of The Tariqa

- That someone who takes the tariqa **no longer moves alone**. He is connected by a lineal chain to the awliya that connects directly to the Prophet Muhammad. And their help reaches this person, that is to say the help of the awliya and of the Prophet reaches them through madad.
- Thus, this is why people in the tariqa can do great things
- When one moves, after taking the wird, then the whole Silsila is moving with one. And whoever moves without it moves alone

# The Prescribed Prayer 

If your salah is lacking, then you are lacking; it reflects a lack of commitment on your part. 

Salah is like an [acid test](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/acid-test) for the state of your heart, revealing your inner spiritual condition. It is the greatest source of light (nur) and acts as a bridge (silla/wasala) between you and the Divine. Salah is also considered the greatest devotional practice (wird). Only those who are deeply in love with Allah or adorned with divine qualities, and who are unattached to the material things of this world, can truly attain this state. Such individuals are known as people of asceticism (zuhd).

# The Secret Of Tahajjud

- The Prophet said, "Our Lord, the Blessed and the Exalted, descends every night to the lowest heaven when one-third of the latter part of the night is left, and says: Who will call upon Me so that I may answer him? Who will ask Me so that I may give him? Who will ask Me forgiveness so that I may forgive him?"
	- Source: Bukhari and Muslim
- These are great words of Allāh because Allāh is saying that He will grant anyone anything in this time, even if things related to the Path, but only if you ask during this time
- This is the special tajjali of rahma, the theophany of the divine
- If anyone is with Allāh in the night, Allāh is with them in the day
- Make sure you don’t leave your tahajjud without asking Allāh for something, even if it’s to spend 5 minutes to tell Allāh that you love Him
- Even if its for 15 to 20 minutes before fajr comes in
- This is one of the greatest secrets of the tariqa

# Gratitude Towards The Divine Is The Secret Of Baraka Itself

- Rise and tell Allāh you love Him, and thank Him for everything that He has given you because in the Quran Allāh has sworn to increase you in everything you have thanked Him in
- In relation to waking up for tahajjud

# Praying For Forgiveness Is One Of The Greatest Secrets Of The Spiritual Path

- This is done through the dhikr of the Shaykh
- Also, done through salatul tawba
    - It’s one of the most important sunnas and acts of the Shadhili tariqa
    - It’s sunna thabita of the Prophet
    - As a Shadhili it’s paramount you know this Salah and perform it often

# The Shariah Is A Matter Of Knowing

- In answers: what is the command of Allāh?
- The tariqa is the practice of this knowledge i.e., the Shariah
- The haqiqa is the resulting spiritual state after having practiced the Shariah through tariqa
- However, don’t rely on your works alone rely on Allāh. At the same time, if you don’t have your net in the water you won’t attain any fish. The net doesn’t create the fish
- Meaning, your wird from the Shaykh is your net. And the fish as it flows in the ocean is the madad of Allāh, you never know when it will come for you. Your job is to keep your net in the water i.e., to maintain your wird patiently every day
- The last words of Sidi Ali al-Jamal were “expose yourself to the fragrant breezes of Allāh.” How? Through your daily awrad from your Shaykh

# Dhikr Is The Means By Which Every Aim In The Tariqa Is Realized

- It’s the fastest and best method
- Shaykh Ahmad al-Alawi said, “It’s the cause of every good (sadaqul khayr).”
- Dhikr is but a seed. It must be sewn in the soil of true intention and covered over and nurtured by love of the awliya and the Prophet. Dhikr without love doesn’t grow anything. Dhikr is watered by daily effort. And it yields its fruit to the daily barakah of the greater reality that you’re connected rather than one’s own mundane domain. This greater reality is the barakah of the tariqa
    - This is obvious but there must be effort
    - Outwardly there is effort (the rasm) and inwardly manifests its inward secret or inward reality (haqiqa)
    - The outward semblance is that: “I must do my wird today again”
    - The inward reality is that: this is a gift from Allāh; it’s the tawfiq of Allāh. Allāh hasn’t loosened your tongue to make remembrance of Him except because He loves you

# The Sign That You Seek Something Through Allāh Is That You’re Indifferent Towards That Thing

- You not only seek it through Allāh, but you seek it for Allāh
- No matter what your destiny is, and how far you make in your ambitions, you will always have the power of your intention
- Your mark in this world with Allāh, if you seek things by Allāh, is not in your actions but in your intention. Allāh determines and rules your destiny, that is sealed forever and ever, by your intention and not only by your actions. Meaning, if you intended to save the world, for the sake of Allāh, but didn’t get to do it – Allāh will record it for you as a hukm in your record that you saved the world because of your noble intention
- This is the secret and the power of intention
- The mark of seeking for Allāh: is that you resolve to do something, and whether it happens or not, the everlasting result/ruling (hukm) with Allāh is that you did it
- When you resolve to do something and do not succeed in doing it, then Allāh inscribes for you that you did it. This is the consequence for infinity. What is the precondition? That you did it for His sake
- The mark that you are seeking something through Allāh is then indifference in that thing
    - Why? Because it’s inscribed for you either way the outcome is manifest
    - Indifference because you then know what’s going on in the sense that you know that it’s written for you
    - Indifference because you know that nothing is inscribed without it being for the sake of Allāh, and knowing that anything that is done for Allāh is a reality recorded
    - This is why the murid is indifferent to the OUTWARD outcome in this world
    - People that don’t have much yaqeen and don’t do much dhikr yearn for outward outcomes to be firm in their belief with Allāh. They need that reinforcements.
    - The murid sees the nur in all things from Allāh and that suffices them. This is the inward reinforcement that the murid suffices with

# The Main Obstacle In The Spiritual Path Is Self-Satisfaction

- My nafs is fine the way it is. I’m happy the way I am
- Whoever identifies with their ego has stopped in their Path. They can’t do anything until they pick up their ego and throw it to the side
- That which you seek is in front of you. That is to say what is in front of you is not your ego

# Your Drawing Close To Allāh Is Only Because Allāh Is Drawing Closer To You

- Or your drawing closer to Allāh is identically one to Allāh’s drawing closer to you
- Allāh is the one doing the favour, you’re not doing any favours to Allāh by drawing closer to Him
- Never forget this

# At Every Single Spiritual Station, The Value You Possess Is What You’re Able To Do

- Therefore, do the best you can because Allāh has done the best for you
- Likewise, do the best for the awliya that He has put forth before you
- A single finger of practice in matters of tasawwuf of this is better than a whole room full of knowledge
