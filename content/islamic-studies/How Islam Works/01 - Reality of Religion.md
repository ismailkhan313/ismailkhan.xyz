The first note in this series of 'How Islam Works' being a collection of notes on the application of Islam as a religion that functions as a monotheistic religion. 

This first note outlines the source basis for the term religion (deen) in Islam. It also covers six usages of the deen and its definitions.
# Deen: Usages & Aspects
## Quran: Meaning of 'religion'
The concept of 'Deen' is richly illustrated in several Quranic verses. The first significant usages that represent the purpose of deen can be found in Quran 1:4 and 51:6. In the Fatiha, it is declared, "Master of the Day of Reckoning," referring to the Day of Judgment, a day dedicated to religion where all debts are either paid off or penalties are suffered. Furthermore, the verse "And the Judgment will certainly come to pass" emphasizes the inevitability of this day.

The most comprehensive usage of the term is seen in Quran 98:5 and 7:29: "They have only been commanded that they worship Allah, making their religion for His sake alone, upright..." This highlights the directive to worship Allah with sincere devotion and uprightness. Additionally, the verse, "Even though they were only commanded to worship Allah ˹alone˺ with sincere devotion to Him in all uprightness, establish prayer, and pay alms-tax. That is the upright Way," further underscores the importance of making religion purely for the sake of God.

Lastly, the command to worship with sincerity and dedication is reiterated in, "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ 'My Lord has commanded uprightness and dedication ˹to Him alone˺ in worship, calling upon Him with sincere devotion. Just as He first brought you into being, you will be brought to life again.'" This verse reinforces the principle of sincere devotion to Allah as an essential aspect of deen.
## 6 usages of the term deen
There are six usages of the term religion (deen): 
1. Root meaning: sense of debt.
2. Essence: choices we make.
3. Consequences: of choices.
4. The Straight Path: the way we take to repay God.
5. Manifestation of Prophet: embodiment of the Way in human form.
6. End Goal: Allah.
## The root meaning of religion (deen)
The **root meaning of religion (deen) is 'to convey a sense of debt, something that is owed to another and due on a certain day.'** This concept of deen is understood as a life debt owed to the Divine, a debt that is repaid because we are created by God. Life itself is considered a gift, and thus, each action and experience within it is also perceived as a gift. The repayment of this debt is manifested through gratitude for these gifts. The day designated for the repayment of this debt is the Day of Judgment.
## The essence of deen
The essence of deen lies in the choices that fulfill the purpose of life, reflecting how we act. These choices either fulfill or neglect the repayment of the life debt owed to the Divine. The Prophet emphasized the importance of one's close friends, stating, "A person will be on the 'deen' of their close friends, so each of you look to what friends you take." In this context, 'deen' does not solely connote a religious sense but rather 'the way' that person is close to, meaning the priorities and influence of others around them is their deen. The phrase "as you are, so shall you find" (a Biblical expression) underscores that the choices made manifest how one is in their life.
## The consequences of these choices
The consequences of these choices culminate in a sound reckoning. Life has an end, and at the final station, there is a reckoning. One's intellect serves as a function to navigate towards this end in the right state, ensuring that the choices made align with fulfilling the life debt owed.
## How a Way relates with deen
'A Way' is a framework or mindset one adopts to live their life. In Islam, the Way is the Straight Path, which is a specific way with a specific goal, much like any other way one can choose in this world. The Straight Path is a sound path enabling one to fulfill the life debt owed, make the right choices, and secure the soundest consequences.
## God embodied deen in the Prophet Muhammad
Following the Straight Path is theoretical and cerebral, lacking practicality. God's mercy simplified our choices by instilling the Way into someone that can be followed because humans make choices based on those of influence, closeness, and merit. Therefore, the deen was embodied in the Prophet, the perfect human manifestation of the Way. Islam is what the Prophet came with and what he embodied. Looking to the Prophet Muhammad helps Muslims correctly pay off the life debt owed to God, understand how to make right choices, comprehend purposeful living, and live a life of conscious choices and awareness.
## The end goal of deen
The end goal of deen is Allah, who is ad-Dayyan, the Reckoner, the one to whom everything is owed, and the one who has granted everything. This brings forth aspects of indebtedness and gratitude. Muslims believe in the culmination of religion, emphasizing that religion is useless without progress toward its end goal, as without an end goal, there is no need for progress.
## Five aspects of Deen
The five aspects of Deen encompass: 
1. divine guidance, 
2. a call to those with understanding, 
3. the nature of choice, 
4. what is ultimately good for us, and 
5. the impact of our choices in this life and the next. 

Firstly, divine guidance originates from God and is conveyed to us through revelation. 

Secondly, the Quran calls upon individuals of understanding, emphasizing the mercy in religion by not providing a rigid instruction manual. Such a manual would reduce life to a mere checklist, whereas the Quran aims to encourage, warn, inspire, and move us, offering a more profound and reflective approach to life. It is a call to those who contemplate, think deeply, and reflect. 

Thirdly, the nature of choice is a profound mystery. Scientifically, it appears that choices are made subconsciously before becoming conscious decisions. The conscious mind is just the tip of the iceberg, while the subconscious forms the bulk beneath the surface, and the unconscious is vast and uncontrollable like the oceans. Despite the complexities, we perceive ourselves and others as having the ability to choose. 

Fourthly, our limited knowledge about ourselves leads us to seek divine guidance to discern the best and good choices, which inherently involves avoiding bad ones. 

Lastly, the mercy of God ensures that our choices have consequences both in this life and the hereafter, highlighting the enduring impact of our decisions.
## The making of choices
In the *Hikam* said, 'The ignorant man wakes up and thinks of the choices they will do today. The intelligent man wakes up and thinks of what God is doing to them today.' This aphorism illustrates a profound approach to making choices. He states that while an ignorant person wakes up considering the actions they will take, an intelligent person contemplates what God has planned for them. Consequently, making meaningful or real choices involves selecting what is most pleasing to God. There are different types of choices: acceptable choices, which are not prohibited and allow one to do as they wish, and choices that range from pleasing and beloved to displeasing and despised by God. Each type of choice has similar associated choices. Hence, true knowledge is not merely about information but about the guidance to choose rightly and achieve the best outcomes. The Prophets and Awliya consistently aimed to make choices that were beloved to God, demonstrating the highest form of intelligent decision-making.

## The truth claims religion must prove
Religion must prove two major truth claims to establish its legitimacy. 
1. How did Islam come directly from God to its initial recipient?
2. How did the religion that came to that initial recipient stay preserved until now?

Firstly, it must demonstrate how Islam originated directly from God to its initial recipient, the Prophet. Muslims assert that true guidance was sent from God to the Prophet and must provide evidence that the Revelation was directly transferred. Without this proof, the claim could be dismissed as merely a human invention. 

Secondly, it must show how this divinely received religion has been preserved until the present day. Muslims claim that the true guidance given to the Prophet has been and will continue to be preserved until the Day of Judgment. If this guidance had been altered, the religion would lose its basis and integrity, rendering it pointless to follow. Some might argue that while the guidance was true initially, it is no longer so today. This claim must be refuted by proving the preservation of the original message. 

Proving these claims establishes that what Muslims practice today is derived from Divine Guidance, faithfully maintained through the clear sayings of the Prophet. It confirms that both the Quran and hadith have been preserved in both text and understanding from their original Divine transmission.
