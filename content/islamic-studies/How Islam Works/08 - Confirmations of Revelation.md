## Confirming Revelation was sent to the Prophet
With the necessity of Revelation and the inimitability of the Quran established, Islam must confirm that the *message* of the Revelation actually took place with the Prophet Muhammad.The verse confirming this is in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:97):

> Say [Prophet], ‘If anyone is an enemy of Gabriel- who by God’s leave brought down the Quran to your heart confirming previous scriptures as a guide and good news for the faithful-

'To your heart' is referring to the heart of the Prophet Muhammad. 

This connection between the Quran and the Prophet is further emphasized by a hadith reported by Sayyida Aisha, who described the Prophet's character as embodying the Quran. Her statement, "His character was the Quran," underscores that the Prophet internalized and lived out the divine message in his daily life, making him the perfect vehicle for its transmission to humanity. The hadith in Sahih Muslim states:

> Qatadah reported: I said to Aisha, “O mother of the believers, tell me about the character of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him.” Aisha said, “Have you not read the Quran?” I said, “O course.” Aisha said, “Verily, the character of the Prophet of Allah was the Quran.” (Sahih Muslim 746)

## 4 ways to develop understanding of Revelation

There are many ways to get a deeper understanding of the Quran. But this note will provide four suggestions as intro points of departure.

First, it is essential to know the human impact of Revelation. This can be explored through books such as "Islam and the World" and "What the World Lost With the Decline of the Muslim Civilization" by Abul Hasan Nadwi. These works provide deep insight into the transformative effect of Revelation on human civilizations. For example, the latter text is related to Islam and highlights the significant contributions of Islamic civilization to the world, as well as the impact of its decline. It provides a historical perspective on how Islamic principles and Revelation transformed societies and brought about advancements in various fields. This book is often recommended for understanding the human impact of Revelation and the importance of Islamic civilization in global history.

Secondly, reflecting on Surah al-Muzzammil in the Quran is crucial, as it describes the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), who was the embodiment of the Quran. This reflection helps in connecting the Revelation to the person who lived it. 

Third, imbibing proper etiquette with the Quran is necessary when engaging with it. The text "Etiquette with the Quran" by Imam an-Nawawi, translated by Musa Furber, serves as an excellent guide for approaching the holy text with the respect and reverence it demands. 

Fourthly, understanding the Quranic challenge is imperative to grasp its unique nature. The book "The Quran: The Eternal Challenge" by Shaykh Abdullah Draz delves into the unmatched aspects of the Quran, explaining why it remains an inimitable miracle. These four methods collectively enhance one's comprehension and appreciation of Revelation.
