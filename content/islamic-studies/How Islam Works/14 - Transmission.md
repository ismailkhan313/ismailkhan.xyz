These next few notes will focus on the concept of 'preservation of the Quran and Sunna.'
## The importance of transmission 

The importance of isnad, or the chain of transmission, cannot be overstated in the preservation of both the Quran and the Sunna. Isnad plays a vital role in ensuring that the teachings have been transmitted accurately and authentically from generation to generation. The significance of isnad is underscored by the saying of Abd Allah ibn al-Mubarak: "The chain of transmission is from the religion: were it not for chains of transmission, anyone could say anything." This highlights that isnad acts as a safeguard against misinformation and fabrications. It is through this meticulous system of verification that both the Quran and Sunna have survived authentically, maintaining their integrity and reliability over centuries.

In general, the purpose of isnad is to establish a sophisticated system of verification for sacred sources. It reflects the rational human inclination to verify important information, whether religious or otherwise. This verification process is integral to human nature and underscores the importance of truth and authenticity in our understanding and practice of religion. Through isnad, Islamic tradition upholds these principles by ensuring that its sacred texts are preserved in their purest and most accurate forms.

## The duty of people
The duty of everyone regarding isnad involves understanding how it was preserved. This knowledge is incumbent upon all believers because it ensures that they comprehend the authenticity and reliability of the teachings they follow. Knowing the principles and history of isnad strengthens one's faith in the accuracy of the religious texts and teachings handed down through generations.

## The isnad is unique
Isnad is uniquely significant to Islamic civilization. Unlike any other tradition to date, the isnad system offers a complete and unparalleled method of verification for any statement, fact, or claim. This meticulous chain of transmission is an exclusive feature of Islamic scholarship, ensuring that the sayings and actions attributed to the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and the Quran are accurately preserved and authenticated.
