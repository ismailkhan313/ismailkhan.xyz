## Two types of preservation Prophetic time

At the time of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), the Quran was preserved through two primary methods: 
1. oral preservation by memorization (hifz) and, 
2. textual preservation by writing (kitaba). 

In the case of oral preservation, some of the Sahaba (companions) were officially assigned by the Prophet to memorize the entire Quran, while others took it upon themselves as a personal responsibility. Textual preservation involved many officially assigned scribes who were tasked with being present with the Prophet to immediately write down the verses of Revelation as they descended. Others in the community would also personally write down the verses and compile their own portions of the Quran, often accompanied by tafsir (interpretations) in their personal notes. For instance, Zaid ibn Thabit was a prominent scribe of the Prophet and was later assigned by the Caliph to compile the entire Quran into a single, written document after the Prophet's passing. These combined efforts of oral and textual preservation ensured the Quran's accuracy and integrity throughout history.

## Oral preservation of the Quran
The oral preservation of the Quran was primarily achieved through the efforts of the Qurra, the official reciters of Revelation. These Qurra were appointed by the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) specifically to memorize and preserve the Quran. They undertook the task of memorizing most, if not all, of the Quran to ensure its accurate transmission. In addition to these official reciters, there was also a broader level of general memorization among the Companions (Sahaba) of the Prophet. Many of the Sahaba memorized varying portions of the Quran, contributing to a widespread culture of oral preservation within the early Muslim community. This dual approach—through the dedicated Qurra and the general memorization by the Sahaba—played a crucial role in safeguarding the Quran's authenticity and integrity.

## Textual preservation of the Quran 

The textual preservation of the Quran was carried out by the Kuttab al-Wahi, who were the official writers of revelation. These formal scribes had the official duty of writing down the Quran as it was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). In addition to their official duties, these scribes often compiled and kept their own personal copies of the Quran, complete with their own notes and tafsir (interpretations). One notable example of such a scribe is Abdullah ibn Masud.

The Kuttab al-Wahi operated on two levels. The first level involved the formal scribes of Revelation, who had the official responsibility of putting the Quran to ink, ensuring its precise and accurate transcription. The second level encompassed the general writing of Revelation, where many individuals within the early Muslim community took it upon themselves to write down the verses of the Quran. This comprehensive approach to textual preservation, involving both formal scribes and general community efforts, ensured that the Quran was meticulously recorded and preserved in written form.

## Miracle of Sahaba's transmitting the Quran  

The miracle of the Quran in relation to the Sahabas' transmission rests in the extraordinary way it was memorized, preserved, and disseminated across the world. The Sahabas not only committed the entire Quran to memory, demonstrating an exceptional level of devotion and mental acuity, but they also specialized in accurately transmitting its verses and teachings. They traveled extensively, from the East to the West, to share the divine message with diverse communities. 

This widespread transmission by word of mouth, without the extensive use of written texts, is remarkable. Despite the vast geographic and cultural distances, the integrity and consistency of the Quran's content were impeccably maintained. This feat underscores a miraculous aspect of the Quran: the precise preservation of its text through human memory across centuries and continents, a task that would be challenging even with modern technology. The fact that the Quran has been transmitted so accurately, remaining unchanged and universally recognized by Muslims around the world, exemplifies its divine nature and the extraordinary role of the Sahabas in ensuring its preservation.
