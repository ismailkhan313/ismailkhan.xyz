## Reliability of past hadith narrators

The reliability of past hadith narrators is established through the rigorous efforts of early hadith scholars (muhaddiths). Their role involved traveling extensively to meet every individual who narrated a hadith. These scholars meticulously scrutinized every behavior and action of the narrators to ascertain their trustworthiness and integrity. This exhaustive process ensured that only those who were deemed reliable and morally upright were accepted as credible transmitters of the Prophet's sayings and actions.

As a result of these meticulous efforts, vast collections of biographical data on the muhaddiths and narrators have been compiled. These collections, or tomes, provide detailed accounts of the narrators, categorizing them as liars, upright, or reliable. This extensive documentation allows for a high level of verification and confidence in the authenticity of the hadiths. 

Incidentally, the degree of detail and scrutiny applied by early muhaddiths is so thorough that modern historians recognize that Muslims have more verifiable facts about the battles of the Prophet than can be confirmed about World War I and World War II. The sheer volume of events and the difficulty in verifying precise details of those world wars often lead to conjecture, while the detailed and methodical approach of the muhaddiths ensures a more accurate preservation of Islamic history.

## Dedication of the Companions and early scholars

The dedication of the Sahabas and early scholars to preserving the hadith was evident in their tireless efforts and rigorous methodologies. To understand their commitment, one must delve into the biographical accounts, history, and travels of the Sahaba (companions of the Prophet) and the Tabi’een (successors of the Sahaba). These early scholars meticulously documented and transmitted the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), ensuring their preservation for future generations.

One notable example is Abu Huraira, who spent four years in the company of the Prophet, memorizing everything he could. His dedication was so profound that he sometimes neglected his basic needs, even fainting in prayer due to hunger. This level of commitment enabled him to become the most prolific narrator of hadith. Other companions like Ibn Abbas, Ibn Umar, Aisha, and Ibn Masud exhibited similar dedication. Their lives were devoted to learning and preserving the teachings of the Prophet, often foregoing personal comforts for the sake of knowledge.

Remarkably, very young Sahabas or Tabi’een who had not attended certain battles or events still possessed detailed knowledge about them. They could provide clarifications to older Sahabas who might have forgotten specific details over time. For these younger companions, the transformation brought about by Islam was momentous, ingraining a deep commitment to preserving its teachings accurately.

It is noteworthy that among the over 100,000 Sahabas, not one hadith exists that misattributes or fabricates the sayings of the Prophet. The issue of fabrications arose only in later periods. The Tabi’een played a crucial role in maintaining the authenticity of hadith by traveling across the expanding Muslim world to seek the most reliable Sahabi narrators. This practice initiated the golden isnad (chain of narrations), which became a hallmark of Islamic scholarship. Following in their footsteps, subsequent Imams and scholars also traveled extensively to verify and compile hadith, further solidifying the integrity and accuracy of the sacred traditions.
