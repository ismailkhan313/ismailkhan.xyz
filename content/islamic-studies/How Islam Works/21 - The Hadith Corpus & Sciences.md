## Emergence of hadith books

The books of hadith began to emerge well after the Prophet's time, even though hadith were written during his lifetime, with an emphasis on oral transmission. The formal compilation of hadith literature was significantly advanced by early scholars such as al-Zuhri, who played a pivotal role in documenting hadith, followed by Imam Malik and many others. The most notable and authoritative collections of hadith, however, emerged from the Six Collections of Hadith Books, which include the distinguished works of Bukhari and Muslim. These collections are highly regarded for their rigorous criteria in authenticating hadith and have become foundational texts in Islamic scholarship, preserving the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) with unparalleled accuracy and integrity.

## Miracle on the universality of the hadith corpus

A remarkable miracle about the universality of the hadith corpus is that there is no alternative body of hadith texts. Despite the vast diversity within the Muslim community and the emergence of various sects and groups that have had significant theological and jurisprudential differences, all of these factions still rely on the same fundamental body of hadith literature. This unified adherence extends across the entire Muslim world, illustrating a profound unity in the foundational texts despite other doctrinal disputes.

Furthermore, even those groups that have diverged from the mainstream still use a substantial amount of the same hadith corpus. While there are particular hadith that may be disputed or rejected by certain sects, no group that identifies itself as Muslim rejects the hadith corpus in its entirety. This widespread acceptance and reliance on the hadith corpus underscore its authenticity, universality, and indispensability in maintaining the cohesive fabric of Islamic teachings and practice across various communities and cultures.

## Supporting hadith sciences 

Three supporting sciences are crucial in hadith and the principles of verification. The first is the Sciences of Hadith (*ulum al-hadith*), which encompasses the methodologies and practices necessary for understanding and authenticating the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). This broad field provides the foundational framework for other specialized sciences.

The second critical science is the Science of Narrators (*ilm al-rijal*). This discipline focuses on the biographies and characteristics of the individuals who transmitted hadith. By meticulously studying the life, integrity, and reliability of each narrator, scholars could determine whether a hadith could be trusted based on its chain of transmission.

The third supporting science is the Science of Critiquing (*al-jarh wa'l ta'dil*). This field involves the systematic evaluation of hadith narrators and transmissions, aiming to identify and expose weak or unreliable narrators and evaluate the authenticity of their narrations. Through this rigorous critique process, scholars ensured that only the most reliable and authentically supported hadith were preserved and transmitted.

The principles of verification were developed to rigorously refute the works of weak and fabricated narrators and hadith. These principles provided a robust mechanism to sift through the vast body of hadith literature, allowing scholars to distinguish between authentic sayings of the Prophet and those that were weak or fabricated. This detailed verification process was fundamental in maintaining the integrity and authenticity of Islamic teachings.
