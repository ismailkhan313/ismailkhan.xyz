## Defining speech

What is speech? A simple definition is that speech consists of words that convey meanings. 

There are 3 critical components to speech:
1. Individual words and their specific indications. 
2. Expressions and the meanings they convey. 
3. Different expressions need to be understood together in context to grasp their full implications.

## Divine wisdom for allowing differences in speech

The divine wisdom in allowing differences in speech lies in establishing principles of sound interpretation. This means that through speech, humans have the capacity to be meticulous and develop the most accurate and effective forms of communication. 

In the Quran (Ali Imran 3:7) states:

> It is He who has sent this Scripture down to you [Prophet]. Some of its verses are definite in meaning- these are the cornerstone of the Scripture- and others are ambiguous. The perverse at heart eagerly pursue the ambiguities in their attempt to make trouble and to pin down a specific meaning of their own: only God knows the true meaning. Those firmly grounded in knowledge say, ‘We believe in it: it is all from our Lord’- only those with real perception will take heed-

This verse highlights the wisdom for having differences in general, indicating that such diversity can lead to a deeper understanding and more rigorous interpretation of language.

This verse addresses the different types of verses within the Quran. Some verses are precise and form the foundation of the Quran, while others are open to interpretation. 

Those with impure hearts focus on the unclear verses in an attempt to spread doubt through false interpretations, but only Allah truly understands their full meaning. 

Those with knowledge recognize the Quran as divine revelation and believe in its entirety. 

The Prophet not only conveyed the Quran but also explained its meaning during his lifetime. These reasons led to the establishment of Islamic schools of law to interpret the Quran and its teachings. It highlights the importance of understanding the chain of transmission, which includes both the text and its understanding.

## The Revelation in Arabic

The divine wisdom in the final Revelation being in Arabic lies in the language’s specificity and clarity. Certain Arabic words possess precise meanings, ensuring that the preservation of these meanings is inherently tied to those specific words. Additionally, the words and meanings in Arabic are crystal clear when compared to other languages, providing an unmatched capacity for conveying detailed and nuanced messages. This linguistic precision and clarity make Arabic an ideal medium for the final Revelation, ensuring that the divine guidance is communicated accurately and remains preserved through time.

## Need for a principles in intepretation

One needs principles of sound interpretation because, when words come together in an expression or statement, they can be either clear or unclear. These principles help in deciphering the meanings behind the words and their expressions. The nature of understanding language lies in recognizing the distinctions and differences in meanings that words convey. Sound interpretation ensures that these meanings are accurately understood, avoiding misinterpretations and ensuring clarity in communication.
