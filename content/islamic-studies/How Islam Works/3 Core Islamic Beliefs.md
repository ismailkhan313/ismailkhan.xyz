## 3 core Islamic beliefs

The three core Islamic beliefs are: 

1. Belief in God.
2. Belief in the Prophets.
3. Belief in the Unseen.
### Belief in God

The first core belief in Islam is the belief in God, known as Allah in Arabic. This monotheistic belief emphasizes that there is only one God, who is the creator and sustainer of the universe. Allah is unique, with no partners, offspring, or equals, and is characterized by absolute perfection, mercy, and justice. Belief in Allah is the foundation upon which all other aspects of the faith are built, representing the central tenet of Islamic theology.

### Belief in the Prophets

The second core belief is the belief in the Prophets. Muslims believe that throughout history, God has sent numerous prophets to guide humanity. These prophets, including Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, served as messengers who conveyed God's revelations to mankind. Prophet Muhammad is considered the last prophet, bringing the final and complete message of Islam through the Quran. The belief in prophets reinforces the importance of following divine guidance and adhering to the teachings revealed to them.

### Belief in the Unseen

The third core belief encompasses the belief in the Unseen. This includes faith in entities and events that are beyond human material perception, such as angels, the Hereafter, destiny, and the Day of Judgment. Angels are considered messengers of God, performing various tasks as commanded by Him. The Hereafter refers to the life after death, where individuals will be held accountable for their actions in this world. Destiny (Qadar) involves the belief that everything happens according to God's will and preordained plan. The Day of Judgment is the final reckoning when all souls will be judged for their deeds and rewarded or punished accordingly.

Collectively, these three core beliefs—faith in God, the Prophets, and the Unseen—form the bedrock of Islamic doctrine, guiding the spiritual and moral compass of Muslims around the world.
