## Primary hadith on asking about unclear matters

A primary hadith addresses the significance of seeking guidance on unclear matters, stating: 

> Al-Nu’man ibn Bashir reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “The lawful is clear and the unlawful is clear, and between the two of them are doubtful matters about which many people do not know. Thus, he who avoids doubtful matters clears himself in regard to his religion and his honor, and he who falls into doubtful matters will fall into the unlawful as the shepherd who pastures near a sanctuary, all but grazing therein. Verily, every king has a sanctum and the sanctum of Allah is His prohibitions. Verily, in the body is a piece of flesh which, if sound, the entire body is sound, and if corrupt, the entire body is corrupt. Truly, it is the heart.” (Sahih Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, *muttafaqun alayhi*)

The main takeaway is, *'The lawful is clear and the unlawful is clear. Between them are unclear matters that most do not know about. So whoever avoids the unclear safeguards their religion and their honour'* 

This hadith is pivotal in Islamic law as it underscores the importance of steering clear of doubtful situations to safeguard one's faith and integrity. Remarkably, this hadith was narrated by a five-year-old, illustrating the profound respect and recognition given to knowledgeable individuals, regardless of age, during the Prophet's time.

### Implications of the hadith on unclear matters

This hadith carries three crucial implications:

1. *Recognition of knowledgeable individuals*: It acknowledges that there are certain people who possess deep understanding and clarity on matters that may be unclear to others.
2. *Seeking guidance*: It advises believers to actively seek out these knowledgeable individuals for guidance and clarification.
3. *Safeguarding religion and honour*: By consulting those with knowledge, believers can avoid doubtful matters and thereby protect their faith and personal honour.
## Issuing fatwa during the Prophet's time

Issuing Islamic legal verdicts (fatwa) held significant importance during the time of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). The Prophet himself taught the Companions (Sahaba) the principles of Shariah, ensuring they had a comprehensive understanding of Islamic law. 

Despite there being approximately 140,000 Sahaba present at the farewell pilgrimage, only a select few—ranging from 8 to 20—were authorized to issue fatwa. This underscores the stringent criteria and high level of knowledge required to provide legal verdicts, ensuring that such decisions were made by those who were thoroughly versed in Islamic teachings and principles. This selective process highlights the critical role of knowledgeable authorities in guiding the Muslim community and maintaining the integrity of religious rulings.
