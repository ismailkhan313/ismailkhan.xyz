## 4 definitions of sunna

The Sunna can be defined in four distinct ways, each encompassing different aspects of its significance. 

In its general meaning, the Sunna refers to the Prophetic Way, embodying wisdom and excellence. This highlights the exemplary lifestyle and behavior of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). 

From an Usuli perspective, the Sunna is considered a crucial source of law and guidance, detailing what one is supposed to do or avoid, thus serving as a formal legislative exemplar. 

Legally, the Sunna represents those actions that are encouraged but not obligatory, guiding believers towards virtuous practices. 

Lastly, in terms of transmission, the Sunna comprises all that has been related concerning the Prophet, including his words, actions, and confirmations, ensuring that his teachings are preserved and followed. 

Together, these definitions illustrate the multifaceted nature of the Sunna as a comprehensive guide for living a life aligned with divine wisdom and principles.

## What is not from the sunna
By definition, something is not considered Sunna under two conditions: 

1. If the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) did not engage in the specific act, and 
2. If the act does not align with the general principles of the Prophetic Way, or the broader Sunna principles. 
Therefore, an action must both have been practiced by the Prophet and be consistent with the overarching values and guidelines of the Sunna to be considered part of it. Anything that fails to meet these two criteria cannot be classified as Sunna.

## Application of sunna

The practical application of the Sunna is nuanced and flexible, based on general principles derived from specific actions of the Prophet. For instance, while specifically serving coffee is not from the Sunna, the broader principle of honoring a guest or displaying generosity is indeed from the Sunna. Hence, serving coffee can embody these general Sunna meanings even if the exact act is not specifically mentioned. 

Practicing the Sunna involves adhering to its universal principles and applying its particular teachings where relevant. One derives these universal principles from the specific actions of the Prophet for practical application across different times and contexts. This interpretative and adaptive process is the crucial work of scholars, who ensure that the Sunna remains relevant and applicable in contemporary settings.

## 5 Meanings of the sunna 

The Sunna encompasses several profound and ultimate meanings that guide a believer's path to spiritual fulfillment. 

Firstly, purification is a fundamental aspect, as highlighted in the Quranic verse, "And he purifies them." 

Secondly, the Sunna serves as the way to Allah, directing individuals towards divine closeness and understanding. 

Thirdly, it also represents the way of presence with Allah, fostering a deep, continuous awareness of His presence. 

Fourthly, the Sunna embodies the way of consciousness, encouraging mindfulness in every action and decision. 

Fifthly, it promotes the concept of submitting to Allah with Ihsan, which means to submit as though one beholds Him, striving for excellence and sincerity in worship. 

Together, these meanings illustrate the comprehensive nature of the Sunna in guiding believers towards a holistic and devout life.
