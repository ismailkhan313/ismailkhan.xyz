## Five part definition of the Quran

Definitions are crucial because they provide clarity and understanding, encapsulating the essence of matters comprehensively. 

As Adib Kallas aptly stated, 'Matters are known by their definitions.'

This principle is vividly illustrated in the five-part definition of the Quran by Imam an-Nasafi in *al-Manar*:

> The Book of Allah, revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through the Angel Gabriel conveyed through mass-transmission (mutawatir), whose recitation is a devotional act.

The Quran is defined as the Book of Allah, which underscores its divine origin. It was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), highlighting the direct communication between the Creator and His final messenger. The revelation was facilitated through the Angel Gabriel, emphasizing the spiritual medium of this divine message. Furthermore, the Quran was conveyed through mass-transmission (mutawatir), ensuring its authenticity as it has been rigorously preserved and transmitted by countless reliable sources. Finally, its recitation is considered a devotional act, underscoring the spiritual and worshipful significance of engaging with its verses. This multi-faceted definition encapsulates the sacred, authentic, and devotional nature of the Quran, and serves a as comprehensive understanding of its importance in Islam.

## Two types of sound transmission
There are two types of sound transmission: contiguous transmission (isnad) and mass transmission (mutawatir). Contiguous transmission involves a successive chain where one person tells another, who then tells another, continuing on until it reaches the one who originally did or said the thing. This ensures a direct and traceable lineage of narration. Mass transmission, on the other hand, occurs when a critical mass of people convey the same information to other large groups of people. This type of transmission involves so many individuals narrating in the same way on such a vast scale that it becomes rationally impossible for all of them to have colluded, conspired, or lied about the information. As a result, what is transmitted through mutawatir is not merely considered opinion but is established as fact, given its critical mass of acceptance making it tangible and undeniably credible.

## Two forms of transmission 

Transmission occurs in two primary forms: oral and aural. Oral transmission involves the spoken wordâ€”one person verbally conveying information to another. Aural transmission pertains to the reception of information through hearing. The Quran serves as the quintessential example encompassing both forms of transmission. It is traditionally recited aloud and memorized through oral transmission, while it is simultaneously learned and preserved through aural means as listeners absorb the recitations. This dual method ensures the Quran's accuracy and authenticity across generations, maintaining its integrity and sacredness through spoken and heard forms of transmission.
