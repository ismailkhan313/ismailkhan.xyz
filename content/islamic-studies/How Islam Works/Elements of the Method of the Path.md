## 3 Elements to the Spiritual Method

A comprehensive spiritual method encompasses three essential elements: 

1. Remembrance.
2. Reminders. 
3. Rectification. 

A comprehensive spiritual method encompasses three essential elements: remembrance, reminders, and rectification. Remembrance involves consistently invoking and being mindful of God, fostering a deep and continuous connection with the Divine. Reminders serve to keep one's focus on spiritual goals, reinforcing the teachings and principles that guide one's path towards God. Finally, rectification involves the process of self-correction and improvement, addressing and rectifying one's faults and shortcomings to align more closely with divine expectations. Together, these elements create a balanced and effective approach to spiritual growth and development.
### Focus on the Remembrance of God

Remembrance of God is a fundamental aspect of Islamic spirituality (*tasawwuf*), deeply rooted in the Quranic injunction found in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:152): 

> So remember Me; I will remember you. Be thankful to Me, and never ungrateful.

The primary benefit of remembering God is that He, in turn, remembers us, fostering a profound reciprocal relationship. Remembrance (*dhikr*) involves not only keeping God's name on one's tongue but also nurturing a constant awareness of His presence. This practice is a key Sunnah, considered the heart of all Sunnah practices, as it facilitates all means of spiritual connection and growth.

### Benefits and Practices of Dhikr

A hadith states: 

> Abdullah ibn Busr reported: A man said, 'O Messenger of Allah, the laws of Islam are too many for me, so tell me something I can hold onto.' The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, 'Keep your tongue moist with the remembrance of Allah.' (Sunan al-Tirmidhii 3375)

The main takeaway, *'Keep your tongue moist with the remembrance of God,'* has been the teaching of the Sufi Shaykhs since.

Maintaining a state of continuous remembrance should be the default condition of the believer. The Companions of the Prophet (PBUH) exemplified this practice; some would remember God so frequently that they placed pebbles in their mouths to prevent themselves from engaging in *dhikr* while on the toilet, because such was their habit of constantly doing *dhikr*. 

In the *dunya*, nothing surpasses the importance of remembering God, unless the act itself is pleasing to God and done with sincerity and gratitude. Such acts, whether they benefit oneself or others, inherently count as remembrance of God, elevating them to a higher spiritual significance in the same way that consistent dhikr does.

These elements together create a framework for a life centered on spiritual consciousness and divine connection, ensuring that one's daily actions and thoughts are aligned with the ultimate goal of pleasing God.

### Importance of Frequent Reminders

God emphasizes the importance of frequent reminders in the Quran, as stated in Surah Adh-Dhariyat (51:55): 

> And go on reminding [people], it is good for those who believe to be reminded.

In other words, *'Remind, for reminders benefit believers.'* Regular and purposeful reminders are essential to keep believers aligned with their spiritual goals. Therefore, one should strive to establish a structured system of reminders, such as a weekly schedule that reinforces the foundational spiritual keys: aim, purpose, path, and method. 

Human beings are prone to error because they often forget, making these spiritual reminders crucial. Such reminders encourage believers to maintain their focus on the four keys, helping them stay on track in their spiritual journey. 

Additionally, it is important to seek specific counsel and give up the delusion that one can achieve everything alone. Spiritual growth is a communal endeavor that benefits greatly from shared wisdom and guidance.

### The Importance of Striving and Constantly Rectifying Oneself

Striving and continuously rectifying oneself is a key aspect of spiritual growth in Islam. As highlighted in the Quran (29:69): 

> But We shall be sure to guide to Our ways those who strive hard for Our cause: God is with those who do good.

This verse underscores that God will be with those who are actively striving towards excellence. The process involves moving from one’s current state to the state that God desires, emulating the beautiful example of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). This means acquiring qualities that are pleasing to God and discarding those that are not. 

As narrated in a hadith, the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) stated: 

> The true mujahid is the one who strives against their lower self (*nafs*) for Allah. (Al-Tirmidhi, *Sunan* 1671)

Spiritual striving (*mujahada*) entails ridding oneself of blameworthy traits and characteristics while cultivating praiseworthy ones. This is the signifiance of the internal jihad on the self. This continuous effort to better oneself spiritually ensures that believers remain on the path of righteousness and divine guidance. This form of *mujahada* is considered a foundational aspect of spiritual growth and self-purification in Islam.
