## Inimitability: the greatest proof of the Quran

The inimitability (i'jaz) of the Quran is the greatest proof of its divine origin because it demonstrates an inability for anyone to copy or produce something exactly as it is. 

The Quran itself issues a divine challenge: to produce anything like it, whether in its entirety, a single chapter, or even just three verses. These verses are in several places in the Quran. 

Surah Al-Baqarah (2:23):

> And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon Our Servant [Muhammad], then produce a surah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses other than Allah, if you should be truthful.

Surah Al-Isra (17:88):

> Say, 'If mankind and the jinn gathered in order to produce the like of this Quran, they could not produce the like of it, even if they were to each other assistants.'

Surah Yunus (10:38):

> Or do they say, 'He invented it?' Say, 'Then bring forth a surah like it and call upon [for assistance] whomever you can besides Allah, if you should be truthful.'

This challenge was presented at a time when the Arabic language was at its pinnacle, comparable to the era of Shakespeare in the English-speaking world. In Arabia, poetry, eloquent Arabic, and pride in spoken language were paramount. Battles were won and lost based on the poetry of one faction over another, with tribes taking as much pride in their poets as in their fiercest warriors. Poets could eloquently undermine the lineage and heritage of enemy tribes, stirring such humiliation and shame that opposing groups would sometimes concede defeat before a battle even began. The Arabs held annual poetry competitions, with the best works displayed on the Kaaba. Moreover, the rich and powerful Arabs of the cities would send their children to learn Arabic from rural and impoverished Bedouins, known for the purity of their language. In this context, where linguistic prowess was deeply esteemed, the Quran's unmatched eloquence and literary excellence stand as undeniable evidence of its divine origin.

## 6 aspects of inimitability

The inimitability (i'jaz) of the Quran can be observed through six distinct aspects:

1. **Eloquence**: Every verse in the Quran reaches the zenith of Arabic eloquence. It is impossible to tweak any verse to enhance its intended meaning, and this applies to each word as well. Substituting any Quranic word with another would fail to convey a more eloquent meaning. This level of eloquence is understood by learning classical Arabic and studying its literary nuances.

2. **Meanings**: The profound and fundamental meanings conveyed by the Quran are inimitable. While translations can provide the primary meanings, they fail to capture the full depth and brevity of the original Arabic verses. The Quran addresses the most profound aspects of human existence, such as the purpose of life, truth, virtue, good, justice, and the nature of human good and evil, as well as the realities of this world and the hereafter. No other expression can fully encapsulate these concepts as effectively as the Quran does.

3. **Truths - Past, Present, and Future**: The Quran contains truths about past events, current realities, and future occurrences. For example, it accurately predicted the outcome of a war between the Persians and the Romans and the timeframe within which this would occur.

4. **Guidance**: The Quran offers unparalleled guidance for humanity, encompassing every aspect of life. Its teachings provide a comprehensive roadmap for living a righteous and meaningful life.

5. **Coherence**: The Quran is remarkably coherent, with no inconsistencies or contradictions. This is encapsulated in the verse: "Had it been from other than God, you would have found much inconsistency." (Quran 4:82). The Quran's perfect harmony further asserts its divine origin.

6. **Perfection**: The Quran's perfection is evident in every aspect discussed above. Its impeccable language, profound meanings, truthful predictions, holistic guidance, and flawless coherence collectively underscore its divine nature and inimitability.

These six aspects collectively highlight the divine challenge presented by the Quran and affirm its status as the greatest proof of its divine origin.
