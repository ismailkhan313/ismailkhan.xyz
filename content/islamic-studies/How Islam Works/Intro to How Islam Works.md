These series of notes endeavours to explore how the scholars of mainstream Islam have diligently preserved the Qur’an, the Sunna, and their understanding from the time of the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) to the present day. By delving into the historical and scholarly efforts, the course aims to elucidate the meticulous processes and unwavering dedication that have safeguarded these sacred texts and teachings across centuries.

In a hadith it states: 

> It has been narrated on the authority of Jabir b. 'Abdullah who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: A group of people from my Umma will continue to fight In defence of truth and remain triumphant until the Day of Judgment. (Sahih Bukhari, Sahih Muslim)

The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) foretold that there will always be a group of his followers who will preserve and uphold his religion, teaching it just as he himself taught it. The text of the hadith is understood that these group of Muslims will be *'unharmed by anyone who opposes them until the Day of Judgment.'*

The scope is to leave the reader with a foundational understanding of the preservation of Islamic teachings. The reader will be able to understand how the Qur’an and Sunna were preserved through history, identify the key elements of the scholarly tradition of mainstream Islam, learn how this scholarly tradition has continuously preserved the understanding of the Qur’an and Sunna, and develop the skills to apply the principles of the Qur’an and Sunna in contemporary times.
