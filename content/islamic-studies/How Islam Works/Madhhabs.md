## Reasons to follow a Madhhab

### Religious duty

Following a madhhab is considered a religious duty for Muslims. The Quran in Surah An-Nisa (4:59) states: 

> You who believe, obey God and the Messenger, and those in authority among you. If you are in dispute over any matter, refer it to God and the Messenger, if you truly believe in God and the Last Day: that is better and fairer in the end.

*'Obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and those in authority over you.'* This verse underscores the importance of obedience to God, which is achieved by following the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad. In turn, the teachings of the Prophet are accurately conveyed and interpreted by pious and knowledgeable scholars in positions of authority. 

### Asking those who know

In [[Scholars and Laymen]] the verse in Surah An-Nahl (16:43) was mentioned, *'Ask those who know if you know not,'* highlighting the necessity of seeking knowledge from those who are well-versed in Islamic teachings. By adhering to a madhhab, believers are essentially following the advice of the Quran to consult knowledgeable individuals who have dedicated their lives to understanding and preserving the faith.

### Following a trodden path in a group

Another necessary reason to follow a madhhab is to adhere to an established, well-trodden path that has been followed by countless others throughout Islamic history. This collective journey offers a sense of continuity and community, as believers walk the same path that has been laid down by generations of scholars and practitioners. This communal approach not only strengthens individual faith but also ensures a unified understanding of Islamic principles.

### Attaining reliable transmission and guidance

The purpose of following a madhhab is to purposefully attain reliable transmission of guidance. This guidance is designed to instill God-consciousness (taqwa), uphold mercy, and lead to outcomes characterized by good, righteousness, virtue, and closeness to God. By adhering to a madhhab, believers are assured that they are following interpretations and practices that have been rigorously vetted and authenticated, providing a trustworthy framework for living a righteous life in accordance with Islamic principles.

## Following a single madhhab

Following a single madhhab sets a standard of God-consciousness (taqwa) and allows for consistent, focused learning, which is more manageable and effective than attempting to study multiple schools of thought simultaneously. Adhering to one madhhab provides a clear and structured approach to religious guidance, emphasizing not just adherence to Islamic practices but doing so with excellence. Excellence in religious practice comes with mastery, which necessitates deep, concentrated study and understanding. Spreading oneself too thin across various madhhabs can dilute this mastery, while not engaging comprehensively with any school can result in a shallow understanding. Therefore, committing to a single madhhab ensures a robust and profound grasp of Islamic teachings, enabling one to practice their faith with both precision and piety.

## Common questions regarding madhhabs

1. *Whom can one follow?* Believers can follow any one of the four fiqh imams. These renowned scholars include Imam Abu Hanifa, Imam Malik, Imam Shafi'i, and Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, each of whom founded one of the major madhhabs or schools of Islamic jurisprudence.

2. *Who is a Mujtahid?* A mujtahid is a great lawmaker in Islam, someone who is capable of independent reasoning in Islamic jurisprudence. Mujtahids possess the necessary knowledge and skills to perform ijtihad, which involves interpreting and deriving rulings from the primary sources of Islamic law.
3. *Is the door ijtihad closed?* No, the door of ijtihad is not conceptually closed. While new schools of thought could theoretically emerge, the consensus is that the existing four madhhabs provide comprehensive methodologies and frameworks. These frameworks suffice in addressing contemporary issues based on their established principles, rules, and guiding philosophies.

4. *What about resolving new issues?* The four main madhhabs have established universal methodologies capable of tackling any problem or issue. By adhering to these time-tested frameworks, scholars can derive rulings and provide guidance that remains true to the core principles of Islamic jurisprudence, thus addressing new and evolving issues effectively.

5. *Does one have to stick to one school?* While it is not mandatory to stick to one particular madhhab, it is generally easier to learn and practice by adhering to a single school. Following one madhhab simplifies the learning process and ensures consistency in religious practice.

6. *Isn't following the Quran and Sunna more 'authentic'?* While following the Quran and Sunna directly may seem more 'authentic,' issues of context and interpretation often arise. The primary texts sometimes use extreme language for literary effect, making sound interpretation crucial. A verified methodology of interpretation helps prevent falling into extremes. One must ask whether they truly understand what the Quran and Sunna are saying and be prepared to substantiate their interpretations.
