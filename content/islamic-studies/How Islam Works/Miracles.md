## What are the roles of miracles?

The role of miracles is to serve as divine confirmation of the prophets' claims as spokesmen on behalf of God. Through miracles, God is indirectly affirming, "My servant is true in what he is saying." These miracles are extraordinary events that people at the time could never have imagined. This is why the Quran emphasizes various miracles performed by different prophets throughout the ages of human civilization. By showcasing these miraculous events, the Quran underscores the authenticity of the prophets and the divine origin of their messages. 

One such verse is Surah Al-Baqarah (2:253):

> Those Messengers: We endowed some of them with gifts more than others; to some of them Allah spoke; others He raised to degrees (of honour); to Jesus the son of Mary We gave clear (signs), and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit.

Similarly, another relevant verse is Surah Al-An'am (6:109):

> They swear by Allah their strongest oaths that if a sign came to them, they would surely believe in it. Say, 'Signs are only with Allah.' And what will make you perceive that even if a sign came, they would not believe.

## The realities of Prophet Muhammad's (saw) miracles

The realities of the Prophet's miracles are numerous, with close to over a thousand reported in the hadith corpus. These miracles were witnessed by those around him, whether they believed in him or not. Some famous examples include the splitting of the moon, which was observed not only by the Arabs but also reported by astronomers in China and India at the time. Another significant miracle is the Isra wal Miraj. During this night journey and ascension, the Prophet was able to describe Jerusalem in intricate detail to his people, despite never having visited it before. Additionally, he accurately described a caravan that was about to arrive in Mecca, including its contents and expected arrival time. Such precise details could only have been known by someone who had actually seen those things at that time, thereby affirming the divine nature of the Prophet's experiences and messages.

## The Quran is the greatest miracle of the Prophet

The greatest miracle is the Quran itself, a lasting testament to divine intervention that endures until the end of time. Its most significant proof lies in its [[Inimitability|inimitability (i'jaz)]], showcasing its uniqueness and unmatched eloquence. Furthermore, the profound message contained within its verses serves as an additional testament to its miraculous nature. The Quran's ability to convey deep wisdom, guidance, and truth in a manner that no human effort can duplicate highlights its divine origin and solidifies its status as the ultimate miracle.
