## 3 verses depicting the Nearness of God

The Quran frequently emphasizes the theme of God's nearness to mankind, reassuring believers of His constant presence and intimate knowledge of their lives. Various verses highlight this profound closeness, offering comfort and guidance.

The Quran 57:4 states:

> It was He who created the heavens and earth in six Days and then established Himself on the throne. He knows what enters the earth and what comes out of it; what descends from the sky and what ascends to it. He is with you wherever you are; He sees all that you do.

This verse illustrates Allah's omnipresence and His comprehensive knowledge of all that occurs in the universe, affirming that He is always with His creation.

Ayatul Kursi (2:255) states:

> God: there is no god but Him, the Ever Living, the Ever Watchful.Neither slumber nor sleep overtakes Him. All that is in the heavens and in the earth belongs to Him. Who is there that can intercede with Him except by His leave? He knows what is before them and what is behind them, but they do not comprehend any of His knowledge except what He wills. His throne extends over the heavens and the earth; it does not weary Him to preserve them both. He is the Most High, the Tremendous.

This verse underscores Allah's eternal vigilance, supreme authority, and boundless knowledge.

Quran 50:16 states:

> We created man––We know what his soul whispers to him: We are closer to him than his jugular vein.

The verse emphasizes God's intimate awareness of human thoughts and emotions. This powerful assertion illustrates that God is closer to us than our own lifeblood, symbolized by the jugular vein, which sustains life and lies between the heart and mind. This closeness signifies that God is more intimately aware of the relationship between our heart and mind than we are ourselves.
## Implications of Divine Nearness

Understanding the nearness of Allah is central to developing a meaningful spiritual relationship with Him. The verses mentioned above remind believers that God is always present, aware, and involved in their lives. This realization encourages a deeper introspection and a sincere effort to attain closeness to one's Lord, fostering a sense of comfort, accountability, and striving for moral and spiritual excellence. Recognizing God's proximity helps believers align their actions and thoughts with divine guidance, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling and conscious worship.

## Surah Yasin: the heart of the Quran

Surah Yasin is often referred to as the heart of the Quran, a sentiment echoed by the scholar Ibn Ajiba. This designation reflects the fact that Surah Yasin encapsulates the central message of the Quran in a concise and powerful manner. The Surah addresses the core themes of the Quran: the omnipresence and reality of Allah's closeness, and the path to attaining that divine closeness. Through its verses, Surah Yasin eloquently conveys the importance of recognizing God's immediate presence in every aspect of life, urging believers to seek and maintain a profound connection with their Creator.

## Closeness to God: a central message of existence

The emphasis on closeness to God as a central message of the Quran underscores its fundamental relevance to human existence. We exist because God sustains us; our very being is continuously dependent on His will and power. This perpetual sustenance implies that God must be closer to us than we can comprehend or perceive. The recognition of this divine proximity forms the bedrock of spiritual understanding and practical faith in Islam. It invites believers to acknowledge their dependence on God, to seek His guidance and presence in every moment, and to strive towards a deeper, more intimate relationship with Him.

In appreciating the message of Surah Yasin and the broader theme of divine closeness, believers gain insight into the essence of their existence and their purpose in life. The notion that God is always near, sustaining and guiding, provides a framework for understanding one's place in the universe and the path to ultimate fulfillment.
