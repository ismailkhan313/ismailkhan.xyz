## Message of the Quran
The Quran delivers a profound message of divine guidance, calling upon those of intellect to make choices that benefit their well-being in both this life and the hereafter. It invites people to reflect, understand, and follow a path that aligns with divine wisdom, emphasizing the importance of making morally and spiritually sound decisions.

## Understanding religion
Religion, in its essence, is the belief in God and a framework for how one interacts with and acts towards God. It encompasses both faith and practice, guiding individuals in their spiritual journeys and everyday lives.

The ultimate purpose of religion is to know and seek God, fostering a deep, intrinsic connection with the divine. This pursuit involves understanding God's nature, aligning one's actions with divine will, and consistently striving towards spiritual growth. The consequence of diligently following this path is salvation, which represents the ultimate reward for those who live their lives in accordance with religious principles, securing their well-being in the hereafter.

## 2 aspects of religion

Religion can be understood through two fundamental aspects: 

1. Belief and,
2. Submission. 

Belief encompasses a spectrum of degrees, beginning with initial acceptance and deepening through understanding and conviction. Submission to God is often the first step toward belief, as it involves recognizing God's authority and aligning one’s actions with His commandments. 

## Verse differentiating between belief and submission

The distinction between belief and submission is clear in Quran (49:14): 

> The desert Arabs say, ‘We have faith.’ [Prophet], tell them, ‘You do not have faith. What you should say instead is, “We have submitted,” for faith has not yet entered your hearts.’ If you obey God and His Messenger, He will not diminish any of your deeds: He is most forgiving and most merciful.

Here, God clarifies the Bedouins who claimed to possess belief, but God corrects them by stating that they have only reached the level of submission. True belief requires faith to penetrate their hearts fully, transcending beyond mere verbal acknowledgment or superficial acceptance.

## Categories of believers

The verse highlights that there are different categories of believers, each corresponding to varying degrees of certainty and spiritual realization. As believers progress in their faith, they move through these categories, attaining higher levels of consciousness and spiritual maturity. 

Those who cultivate more faith achieve elevated degrees of awareness and understanding of divine realities. Belief that remains without doubt is inherently at a lower level than belief infused with experiential knowledge and actualization of divine truths.

### Perfecting belief in consciousness

Perfecting belief involves reaching a state where God's presence is recognized in all aspects of life. It moves beyond mere intellectual assent or ritualistic adherence to embody a continuous, profound awareness of divine reality. In this state, a believer sees God in everything and every circumstance, thus living in perpetual acknowledgment of God’s presence and attributes. This perfected state of belief is characterized by an incessant mindfulness and spiritual vigilance.

### Quranic insight on degrees of righteousness

Another verse also alludes to varying levels of spiritual attainment in Quran (35:32): 

> We gave the Scripture as a heritage to Our chosen servants: some of them wronged their own souls, some stayed between [right and wrong], and some, by God’s leave, were foremost in good deeds. That is the greatest favour:

This verse emphasizes that believers exist on a spectrum of righteousness and commitment. Some may merely comply with basic obligations, others maintain a moderate level of practice, and yet others strive to excel in their devotion and good deeds. Each stage represents a deeper commitment and a more refined spiritual state, encouraging believers to continuously seek higher levels of faith and righteous conduct.

## Degrees of righteousness in belief in God

Belief in God can manifest in three degrees of righteousness:

1. Mere belief
2. True belief
3. Perfected belief

The first degree is mere belief, where individuals accept the fundamental tenets of faith but may do so with limited understanding or conviction. This stage involves a basic acknowledgment of God's existence and attributes. The second degree is true belief, where faith deepens, and believers develop a more substantial understanding and connection to their religious principles. This stage involves not only intellectual acceptance but also emotional and spiritual commitment. The highest degree is perfected belief, characterized by an unwavering and comprehensive faith that permeates every aspect of one's life. In this state, believers fully internalize and live out the principles of their faith, demonstrating a profound and continuous awareness of God's presence and will.

### Degrees of righteousness in submission to God

Submission in Islam can also be categorized into three degrees of righteousness: 

1. Mere submission
2. True submission
3. Perfected submission

The first degree is mere submission, where individuals perform the basic obligations and practices of Islam without deeper reflection or understanding. This stage involves adherence to the rituals and rules of the faith at a surface level. The second degree is true submission, where individuals embrace the practices of Islam with genuine understanding and devotion. In this stage, the acts of worship are performed with sincerity and a conscious awareness of their purpose. The highest degree is perfected submission, where individuals not only fulfill their religious duties but do so with excellence (Ihsan) and a constant sense of divine observation. In this state, every action is carried out with the intention of seeking God's pleasure, leading to a harmonious alignment of one's life with divine guidance.
