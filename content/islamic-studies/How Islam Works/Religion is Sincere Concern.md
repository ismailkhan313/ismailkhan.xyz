## Hadith: religion is sincere concern 

In an oft-cited and learned hadith it is narrated: 

> On the authority of Tamim Al-Dari (may Allah be pleased with him): 
> 
> The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "The religion is naseehah (sincerity)." We said, "To whom?" He (peace be upon him) said, "To Allah, His Book, His Messenger, and to the leaders of the Muslims and their common folk." (Sahih Muslim)

## Religion and sincere concern (*nasiha*)

In relation to the hadith on nasiha above, religion (*deen*) can be understood as the way one lives their life, embodying the principle that *'as one lives, so one shall find.'* This concept underscores the idea that the way we conduct ourselves and live our lives is essentially a debt we owe to God, highlighting the intrinsic connection between daily actions and spiritual obligations. 

Sincere concern (*nashiha*), similarly, is intricately linked to deen within this context. Linguistically, *nashiha* means to purify something completely, suggesting that true sincerity requires a thorough and genuine commitment to purity and honesty in one's intentions and deeds. The intertwining of *deen* and *nashiha* in the hadith emphasizes the importance of living a life of integrity, where one's faith is manifested in sincere and earnest actions towards oneself, others, and God.

*Nasiha* is fundamentally about sincere concern that permeates every aspect of the faith. Broadly speaking, *nasiha* involves caring deeply and earnestly for others, reflecting a profound sense of responsibility and empathy. 

Specifically, it entails seeking the good with respect to another, whether through offering advice, support, or constructive criticism. This concept of sincere concern extends to all dimensions of the Islamic faith, encompassing relationships with God, His Book, His Messenger, and His Creation. By integrating *nasiha* into every interaction and decision, a believer upholds the core values of Islam, ensuring that their conduct is guided by genuine care and a commitment to the well-being of others.

## 2 types of concerns

There are two primary types of concerns within the framework of *nasiha*:

1. Spiritual concern. 
2. Social concern. 

Spiritual concern involves cultivating an attitude where all actions and decisions are oriented towards the divine. This means ensuring that whatever one undertakes is for the sake of Allah, aligned with His Book, and in accordance with the teachings of His Messenger. This form of concern reflects a deep, internal commitment to spirituality and religious principles. 

On the other hand, social concern pertains to the well-being and integrity of the broader Muslim community. It involves sincere concern for the leaders of the Muslims, ensuring they are guided and supported in their roles, as well as for the common person, fostering a sense of solidarity and mutual care among individuals. Both types of concerns are essential in embodying the true spirit of nasiha within Islam.
