In the previous note [[Methodology of Interpretation#Divine wisdom for allowing differences in speech]] the verse in Surah Ali Imran (3:7) confirms the necessity of interpretation in understanding the Quran. The previous note highlights that some verses in the Quran are decisive and do not require interpretation, as they are indisputable and clear. In contrast, other verses are indecisive or elusive and therefore require interpretation.

Interpretations of the indecisive verses can be valid or invalid, underscoring the need for sound interpretation to ensure their validity. Hence, the various Islamic legal schools of thought (madhhabs) emerged to provide regular Muslims with a sound methodology for interpreting these indecisive verses. This methodology ensures that Muslims who are not at the level of independent legal reasoning (ijtihad) can distinguish between valid and invalid interpretations and apply sound reasoning in understanding the Quran. This structured approach helps maintain the integrity and authenticity of the Quranic teachings by ensuring they are interpreted correctly and consistently.
