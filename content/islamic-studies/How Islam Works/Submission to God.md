## Verse of sincere submission to God

The verse that emphasizes the importance of sincere submission to God is found in Quran 98:5: 

> Though all they are ordered to do is worship God alone, sincerely devoting their religion to Him as people of true faith, keep up the prayer, and pay the prescribed alms, for that is the true religion.

The main highlight to call out on this verse is, *'sincerely devoting their religion to Him as people of true faith.'* This verse highlights that all of humanity is commanded to worship Allah alone, with genuine and wholehearted devotion. It calls for submission characterized by sincerity and righteousness, highlighting the fundamental acts of establishing prayer and paying alms-tax as essential components of this upright path. In doing so, it reinforces the core obligation for all individuals to submit to Allah sincerely and devoutly, which constitutes the essence of true worship and righteous living.

### Submission in relation with faith

Submission is intrinsically related to faith in that faith encompasses submission, but it demands more than just mere acts of compliance. As stated the above verse (98:5), believers are commanded to worship Allah alone with sincere devotion, embodying uprightness. This indicates that true faith requires submission to be genuine and wholehearted. Therefore, while faith indeed entails submission, it is the sincerity and devotion within that submission which transforms it into an expression of true faith. Thus, submission becomes a manifestation of faith only when it is carried out with sincere devotion to God.

### The purpose of sincerity

The purpose of sincerity is to make one's actions pure, free from any ulterior motives or external influences. Sincerity in actions means that the intention behind every deed is solely for the sake of God. There are various degrees of sincerity, and as one grows in their spiritual journey, their level of sincerity can deepen and become more refined.

### Opportunity for sincerity with God

Every act of submission presents an opportunity to be sincere with God. Each prayer, charitable act, and moment of devotion offers a chance to connect with God on a deeper level, striving for purity of intention. This pursuit is not just about performing religious duties but about seeking to align one’s heart and soul with God’s will. Through sincere submission, believers can strive to seek God more earnestly.

### Purpose of seeking God

The ultimate purpose of seeking is to find what one is looking for. In the context of faith, the goal is to find and connect with God. This quest for God is the Straight Path that He has ordained for humanity. The end destination of this path is God Himself, signifying the culmination of a believer’s spiritual journey. By seeking God with sincerity, believers travel along this divine path, striving towards the ultimate goal of unity with their Creator.
