## Definition of a authentic hadith

An authentic (sahih) hadith is defined by five key criteria: 
1. One who is morally upright.
2. Reliable narrator from the same generation of people.
3. Contiguously narrated (no gaps in narration).
4. Free from hidden defects.
5. No errors.

It is a report transmitted by a narrator who is morally upright, ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of the person conveying the information. The narrator must also be reliable, with a reputation for accuracy and consistency within their generation of contemporaries. The hadith must be contiguously narrated, meaning there are no gaps or missing links in the chain of transmission from the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) to the final recorder. Additionally, the hadith should be free from hidden defects that could compromise its authenticity. Lastly, it must be devoid of errors, ensuring that the content has been accurately and faithfully preserved. These criteria collectively ensure that a sahih hadith is both credible and authoritative.

## Impetus to verify in the Quran

The necessity of verification is explicitly stated in the Quran, particularly in Surah Al-Hujurat (49:6): 

> Believers, if a troublemaker brings you news, check it first, in case you wrong others unwittingly and later regret what you have done.

This verse confirms the requirement and the importance of verifying information, particularly religious information. The reasons why verification in religion are numerous. What can be highlighted here is the need for careful scrutiny and corroboration of news and reports.

## A duty for conveying carefully

A mass-transmitted (mutawatir) hadith further emphasizes the careful and accurate transmission of the Prophet Muhammad's (PBUH) words. 

The hadith states:

> Zayd ibn Thabit reported, 'May Allah illuminate the countenance of one who hears my words; retains them fully; encompasses them in understanding; and then conveys them [as they heard] to those who didn't hear them.' (Sunan Abu Dawud 3660)

This hadith outlines the critical steps in the transmission process: 
1. Hearing the words, 
2. Retaining them fully, 
3. Comprehending them thoroughly, and 
4. Conveying them exactly as heard to others. 

These steps ensure that the teachings of the Prophet are preserved with precision and passed on faithfully to future generations. Importance is placed on accurate transmission and understanding of his teachings, encouraging his followers to listen carefully, retain, comprehend fully, and convey his words faithfully.
