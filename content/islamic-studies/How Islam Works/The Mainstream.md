In following our previous note [[Quran as the Final Revelation]], this note focuses our understanding th at the essence of Truth in Divine Guidance is crucial for every spiritual seeker.

This note focuses on the Mainstream being manifest on the Truth.
## What is the Truth?
The Truth is represented in Divine Guidance, encompassing both a form and a spirit. 

The *spirit* of the Truth is mercy, as indicated by the Quranic verse, "We have not sent you [Muhammad] except as a mercy" (Quran 21:107). 

The *form* of the Truth is embodied by those who manifest this spirit in their words and actions. The Prophet Muhammad said: 

> "There will always remain a group in my community manifest on the truth, unaffected by those who oppose them, until the Command of Allah comes." (Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim) 

This group is composed of those who uphold the Truth, specifically the scholars and the mainstream followers of Islam. While the scholars are generally seen as upholders of the Truth, it is important to note that this does not imply every scholar embodies the Truth. Muslims follow the Truth rather than individuals, using scholars as means to understand it. 

Following scholars is principled, unlike following oneself, which can lead to changing principles at will. 

The Prophet also stated, "The scholars are the inheritors of the prophets." Those who directly benefit from the guidance of scholars are considered the mainstream community of Muslims.
## Five components for the preservation of the Straight Path
Five components for the preservation of the Straight Path:
1. God promised the Straight Path will be preserved,
2. In word and in meaning, 
3. In the final revelation and sayings of the Prophet, 
4. Through the preservation of the scholars, 
5. That is always manifest in the mainstream community
## Who are the Mainstream?
The Mainstream comprises those who adhere to the preserved understanding of the Prophet's sayings and the Quran. It represents the overwhelming majority of Muslims who follow the sound Islamic tradition and scholarship. The Mainstream corresponds to the way of the Prophet, which remains clear and preserved until the end of time, even in confusing periods. It is not a private club or an elitist secret community. Unlike sectarians, who claim exclusivity in salvation, the Mainstream is inclusive, welcoming Muslims from all backgrounds, including those from Sufi traditions or otherwise.

The Mainstream is a point of belief affirmed by the Quranic verses on preservation and consulting the people of remembrance. These verses establish that those following the people of remembrance constitute the Mainstream. God's will to preserve the Straight Path includes ensuring that the people of remembrance persist in their knowledge of Deen, as long as the Straight Path is preserved, which is until the end of time. Belief in the Mainstream is further reinforced by the Prophet's statement that they are the ones manifesting the Truth. Thus, guidance is preserved not only in word and meaning but also through the Way of the Mainstream, who adhere to the texts and sayings of the Deen.

This corresponds in *Aqidah Tahawiyyah* where Imam At-Tahawi states, "We consider that holding together and remaining with the Mainstream (Jamāʿah) is the true and right course, and that sectarianism (i.e., separation) is deviation leading to punishment." 
## Five components defining the Mainstream
The group manifest on Truth is constituted by five key components. 
1. Preserved sound understanding,
2. Transmitted by scholars,
3. Mainstream,
4. Known and clear,
5. Ahlul Sunna wal Jamaah.

Firstly, it encompasses a preserved sound understanding, which includes the sayings conveyed by the Prophet, both in word and meaning, as well as verses from the Quran, in their literal and contextual meanings. It also covers how mankind can make righteous choices, seek closeness to God, and strive to perfect their religion throughout their lives. This preservation extends to the concepts of faith (iman), worship and religious practice (islam), and turning to God (ihsan). In terms of Sunni and Shia perspectives, the differences are primarily in secondary details, with no significant divergence in fundamental matters, though some of these differences can be critical. 

Secondly, the transmission of this understanding is carried out by scholars, who ensure the preservation of the Deen by passing it from one generation to the next, continuously from the beginning until the end. 

Thirdly, this transmission is embodied in the mainstream community, which provides evidence through a remarkable consensus among the ummah on a wide range of issues, achieved with minimal organizational efforts compared to other religions. 

Fourthly, the truth is known and clear, not hidden from the believers, and is accessible to all. This is contrasted with the heretical Ismailis, who claim that truth is held by an old man in the mountains, accessible only to the chosen few.

Lastly, Ahlul Sunna wal Jamaah refers to those who adhere to all of the above components. It is important to note that those who excommunicate others while claiming to be part of this group do not qualify. 

What derive out of this are four principles of the Mainstream:
1. Truth is Preserved.
2. Truth is Known.
3. Truth is preserved and known by the scholars.
4. When unclear, they seek scholars.
We can take an example on four manifestations of Truth:
1. Following Prophet Ibrahim in the way of the Hanif: All Muslims are guided by his way, which represents uprightness and a commitment to Truth. Prophet Ibrahim not only spoke the Truth but lived it through his actions and conduct.
2. Following Abu Bakr in the way of the Siddiq: Abu Bakr is known as the champion of Truth, embodying veracity in his life. He consistently confirmed the truth, living and sacrificing for it with unwavering dedication.
3. Mirroring of Fatima in the way of Radiance: Fatima exemplified the Prophetic character and qualities with exceptional accuracy. Her conduct and concerns were a reflection of the Prophet’s impeccable character.
4. Way of Prophet Muhammad (saw): This manifestation encompasses Mercy, Virtue, Beauty, and Excellence, reflecting the comprehensive and holistic embodiment of Truth through the life and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad.
