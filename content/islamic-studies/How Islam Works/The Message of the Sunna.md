## The main message of the Sunna

The main message of the Sunna is encapsulated in the principle that actions are judged by their intentions. This foundational concept is emphasized in many hadith collections, even often as the first hadith quoted. 

In the first hadith of Imam an-Nawawi 40 collection: 

> Actions are by intentions. And each person will have whatever they intended.

This teaching underscores the importance of aligning one's inner purpose with their outward actions, making intention the cornerstone of sincere and meaningful behavior.

## Lessons of right intention

First, having the correct intention is a prerequisite to sincerity (ikhlaas). Without pure intentions, actions lack the necessary spiritual quality that makes them acceptable and pleasing to God. 

Second, the reality of our actions in seeking God is inherently tied to our intentions. The spiritual value and efficacy of our deeds are determined by the underlying motives, thereby shaping our journey towards divine proximity and approval. Hence, cultivating right intention is essential for genuine sincerity and the spiritual fulfillment of religious duties.
