## Qualities Required to Turn to God 

As mentioned by Sidi Ahmed Zarruq there are two qualities required to turn towards God: 
1. God-consciousness (*taqwa*).
2. Uprightness (*istiqama*).

## God-consciousness (*taqwa*)

The first essential quality required to turn to God is taqwa, which refers to mindfulness, Godfearingness, and God consciousness. Taqwa involves turning to God in the ways He has commanded and striving to act in ways that are pleasing to Him. It requires refraining from disobedience, for how can one seek God if they are not committed to following His guidance? Taqwa is about living with a constant awareness of God's presence and making choices that reflect this consciousness.

### Uprightness (*istiqama*)

The second crucial quality is istiqama, or uprightness. This quality is sought in every recitation of Al-Fatihah, where believers ask God to guide them on the straight path. God responds to this plea in the opening of Surah Al-Baqarah, stating that the Quran is guidance for those striving to attain God consciousness. Istiqama involves following Siratul Mustaqeem, the path of the Prophet and the path characterized by taqwa. The Quran instructs believers to "be upright in how you have been commanded," emphasizing the importance of living righteously. The result of embodying istiqama is the ability to behold God.

#### 3 Qualities of Istiqama

Istiqama encompasses three main qualities: turning in the right direction, heading in the right way, and walking straight. These qualities ensure that a believer's journey towards God is steadfast and aligned with divine guidance. By embodying istiqama, one maintains a continuous and unwavering commitment to righteousness and spiritual integrity.
