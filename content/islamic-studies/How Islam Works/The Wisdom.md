## Definition of wisdom
Wisdom can be defined in several ways, all of which revolve around the capacity to make good judgments. Generally, wisdom involves making the most out of an intellectual, rational decision at a given time. It encompasses the ability to apply knowledge appropriately in a given circumstance or consequence, ensuring that the outcome is beneficial. This ability to exercise sound judgment first necessitates a foundation of sound knowledge. Knowledge itself is the capacity to perceive things accurately, while wisdom is the skill of placing that knowledge in its proper context and using it to achieve positive outcomes. Thus, wisdom is not merely about knowing what is true, but about utilizing that truth effectively to make prudent decisions.

## Sunnah and wisdom
The relationship between the Sunna and wisdom is deeply intertwined, as the Sunna represents the best way to respond to any given situation with prudence and understanding. By following the Sunna, one acts in a manner similar to the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), who is the closest creation to God and the embodiment of divine wisdom. The Sunna encompasses the words, actions, manners, and affirmations of the Prophet, serving as a comprehensive guide for Muslims to emulate. In essence, adhering to the Sunna is a manifestation of living wisely, as it reflects the Prophet's ability to apply divine knowledge in the most beneficial and appropriate ways.
