## The end goal of faith

The end of faith transcends mere verbal affirmation and reaches towards full realization. As stated in Quran 57:4:

> It was He who created the heavens and earth in six Days and then established Himself on the throne. He knows what enters the earth and what comes out of it; what descends from the sky and what ascends to it. He is with you wherever you are; He sees all that you do;

'He is with you wherever you may be,' true faith involves internalizing this constant divine presence. Itâ€™s about "submitting to Allah as though you behold Him," striving to exist in a perpetual state of awareness and witnessing of God. This profound spiritual state goes beyond superficial declarations of belief, inviting believers to immerse themselves fully in the reality of their faith as if it were a tangible and ever-present truth. The ultimate goal is not just to acknowledge God's existence with words, but to live continually in the presence of God's reality, deeply embedded in one's heart and actions.
