## 3 main understandings of who Allah is

There are three main understandings that encapsulate the essence of who Allah is:
1. He is Necessary.
2. Absolutely free of need of any other, whom all are absolutely in need of.
3. Creator and Sustainer.

Firstly, Allah is Necessary, meaning He is the fundamental existence upon which everything else depends. His existence is absolute and essential, unlike the contingent existence of His creation. 

Secondly, Allah is absolutely free of need of any other, while all of creation is in absolute need of Him. This underscores His self-sufficiency and the dependence of everything else on His will and provision. 

Lastly, Allah is the Creator and Sustainer. He not only brought everything into existence but also continuously maintains and nurtures His creation. 

These aspects highlight Allahâ€™s unparalleled power, mercy, and authority, forming the foundational understanding of His nature in Islamic theology.

## 3 components of understanding God

Understanding God in Islamic theology comprises three critical components:
1. The Names of Allah
2. The Attributes of Allah: all perfections
3. The Transcendence of Allah

First, the Names of Allah serve as fundamental descriptors of His nature, providing believers with insights into His attributes and characteristics. Each name, whether it is Al-Rahman (The Most Merciful) or Al-Hakim (The All-Wise), reveals specific aspects of God's essence and His relationship with creation. 

Second, the Attributes of Allah encompass all perfections, indicating qualities such as omnipotence, omniscience, mercy, and justice. These attributes underscore His absolute and unparalleled excellence in every conceivable way. 

Third, the Transcendence of Allah highlights His supreme and incomparable nature, emphasizing that no part of creation can be likened to Him. He is beyond all human understanding and limitations, existing in a state of absolute purity and perfection.

Together, these components provide a comprehensive framework for believers to grasp the multifaceted nature of God, facilitating a deeper spiritual connection and reverence.

## 2 necessary affirmations of God 

In Islamic theology, two necessary affirmations of God are:

1. His Eternal nature and, 
2. His Absoluteness. 

Affirming that God is Eternal means recognizing that He has no beginning nor end; His existence is timeless, unbounded by the constraints of space and time that govern His creation. This eternal nature underscores the perpetual and infinite presence of God. 

Additionally, affirming that God is Absolute emphasizes His complete and total perfection, independence, and self-sufficiency. He is not reliant on anything or anyone, while all of creation depends entirely on Him. These affirmations stress the unique and supreme nature of God, reinforcing the foundational Islamic belief in His unmatched and unrivaled existence.

## 4 components of God's actions

### Components of God's Actions

The understanding of God's actions in Islamic theology involves four key components:
1. One Creator.
2. Decree and Destiny.
3. Reliance and Trust.
4. Human Actions as acquired responsibility.

Firstly, the belief that there is One Creator, affirming that all existence originates from and is sustained by God alone. 

Secondly, the concepts of Decree and Destiny (Qadr), which encompass God's comprehensive knowledge and control over everything that happens in the universe, affirm His ultimate authority and wisdom. 

Thirdly, Reliance and Trust (Tawakkul) on God encourage believers to depend on God's wisdom and provision in all aspects of life, fostering a sense of peace and security in His divine plan. 

Lastly, human actions are seen as an acquired responsibility. While God has granted humans moral choice, He does not impose our decisions upon us. Instead, He provides guidance and points to signs so that we may choose correctly. Consequently, individuals are held accountable for their choices, emphasizing the human responsibility to align actions with divine guidance. 

These components collectively highlight the dynamic interaction between divine sovereignty and human agency.
