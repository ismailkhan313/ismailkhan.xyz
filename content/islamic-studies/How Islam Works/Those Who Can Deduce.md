## Verse on the role of those in authority

The verse in Surah An-Nisa (4:83) states: 

> Whenever news of any matter comes to them, whether concerning peace or war, they spread it about; if they referred it to the Messenger and those in authority among them, those seeking its meaning would have found it out from them. If it were not for God’s bounty and mercy towards you, you would almost all have followed Satan.

This verse underscores the importance of those in authority, stating, *'If they had referred it to the Messenger and to those of authority among them, then those of them whose task it is to find it out would have known the matter.'* It highlights that those in authority are individuals endowed with knowledge and wisdom. These knowledgeable individuals bear the responsibility of informing and guiding those who lack such knowledge. It is explicitly clear that those who do not know should defer to those who do, and they should not falsely claim understanding they do not possess.

## Responsibilities of authorities and the uninformed

The verse implies a clear division of roles: those in authority, who have the capability to deduce and interpret matters, must guide the uninformed. This responsibility is crucial, as it ensures that the knowledge is correctly interpreted and disseminated among the believers. Conversely, those who do not possess the requisite knowledge should acknowledge their limitations and seek guidance from trusted authorities.

## Implications of verse 4:83 and verse 16:43

In our previous note [[Scholars and Laymen]] we mentioned a verse in surah An-Nahl (16:43), *'Ask the People of Remembrance if you know not.'* 

The three critical implications derived from Quran 16:43—categorizing believers, recognizing knowledgeable individuals, and emphasizing the duties of general believers—also apply to Quran 4:83. 

In both verses, the emphasis is placed on the necessity of consulting those who possess a deeper understanding and the responsibility of these knowledgeable individuals to provide accurate guidance. This reinforces the structured approach in Islamic scholarship where knowledge is preserved and transmitted through recognized authorities, ensuring the integrity and continuity of religious teachings.
