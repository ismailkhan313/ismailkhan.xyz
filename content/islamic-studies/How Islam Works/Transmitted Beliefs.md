## Relationship of the resurrection and afterlife to transmitted beliefs

The resurrection and afterlife are integral aspects of transmitted beliefs in Islam. These concepts encompass knowledge that lies beyond human consciousness and experiential reality, anchored in divine revelation rather than empirical observation. Through the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, believers are provided with insights into the afterlife, the resurrection, and the events that will transpire beyond this worldly existence. This knowledge transcends human sensory experience and is accepted on the foundation of faith in the divine message.

## Existential truths beyond transmitted beliefs

In addition to the resurrection and afterlife, there are other truths that extend beyond the scope of human knowledge as conveyed through transmitted beliefs. The infiniteness of God implies that His creation and reality are far more vast and complex than what humans can fully comprehend. While the transmitted beliefs provide a framework for understanding critical aspects of existence and the divine, they also acknowledge the limitations of human cognition. Consequently, believers are encouraged to recognize that God's creation encompasses mysteries and truths yet unrevealed or beyond human grasp, underscoring the boundless nature of divine reality.
