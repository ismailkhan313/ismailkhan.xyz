## The Ruling to Believe

Belief in Islam is regarded as a legal ruling (*hukm sharâ€™i*) rather than a rational ruling. It is binding according to the sacred law (*shariah*).

Belief is obligatory upon every legally responsible person (*mukallaf*), whether male or female, free or slave, to know what is necessary for Allah, what is impossible and what is possible.

## The Obligation of Knowledge

According to the sacred law (*shariah*), it is obligatory for every legally responsible person, whether male or female, free or slave, to know what is necessary for Allah, what is impossible, and what is possible.

An obligation means that one must fulfill it. Failing to do so makes one accountable on the Day of Judgment, liable to reward or punishment, from God. 

Therefore, the ruling is that the *mukallaf* must know what is necessary, possible, and impossible in relation to Allah in that which is considered obligatory (*fard*) by the authoritative scholars in matters of belief. As a consequence the mukallaf needs to know what it means *'to know'* and the obligation to acquire knowledge becomes due.

In the matter of beliefs conformity (*taqlid*) is not acceptable according to Imam al-'Ilish.
