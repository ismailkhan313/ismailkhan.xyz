This intro note is the first in a series of atomic notes covering the didactic poem of Imam [[Ahmad ad-Dardir]] (d. 1201AH) entitled [[Kharida al-Bahiyya]] or the Glimmering Pearl. It is an introductory text for students of â€˜ilm al-kalam. It is popular for the easiness of its language, and the status of its author, who was a late Maliki scholar hailing from Egypt. Like many other works written for teaching purposes in the Islamic world, the *Kharida* is actually a didactic poem. Traditionally, students studying this poem under a teacher, would be expected to memorize the entire text, before attending lessons with their teacher in which he would commentate on each line.

These series of atomic notes will rely on lessons taken on this poem from Shaykh Faraz Rabbani (Canada) at SeekersGuidance, and various english translations of this text.
