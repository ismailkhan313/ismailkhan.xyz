## 3 core subjects of Islamic beliefs

The three corse subjects of Islamic beliefs are: 
1. God.
2. The Prophets.
3. The Hereafter.

The value of one's knowledge in Islam is intricately tied to the value of what one knows about these fundamental beliefs. Understanding and internalizing the core principles related to Allah, the Prophets, and the Hereafter can profoundly impact a believer's faith and practice. Knowledge in Islamic teachings is not merely about intellectual acquisition but about cultivating a deeper comprehension and connection to these vital aspects of the religion. Thus, the depth and quality of one's knowledge directly enhance the value it brings to one’s spiritual and everyday life.

## 6 reasons to know Islamic beliefs

Understanding Islamic beliefs gives the Muslim theological knowledge towards fostering a stronger faith. These are 6 reasons to know Islamic beliefs: 

1. To know the necessary, possible, and absurd for Allah; likewise for His Prophets, and matters of transmitted beliefs.
2. To understand the details of sound beliefs.
3. To know first principles that support belief.
4. To know the proofs for core beliefs.
5. The increase in faith and certitude.
6. The attainment of Closeness and Beholding.

First, it is essential to grasp what is necessary, possible, and absurd concerning Allah, His Prophets, and matters of transmitted beliefs. Knowing these distinctions helps believers navigate their faith with clarity and correctness, ensuring their beliefs align with fundamental Islamic teachings. This foundation supports a robust comprehension of what is doctrinally sound and what is not.

Second, sound beliefs form the bedrock of a Muslim’s faith, and having a detailed understanding prevents misconceptions. A reasonable depth of knowledge ensures that believers can articulate their faith accurately and live it out authentically in their daily lives.

Third, knowing the first principles that support belief is also necessary. These principles serve as the foundational truths upon which other teachings and practices build. Without a strong grasp of these initial concepts, a believer's understanding of more complex doctrines can become shaky.

Fourth, understanding the proofs for core beliefs is indispensable. These proofs offer logical and scriptural backing for Islamic tenets, which can strengthen a believer’s conviction and provide them with the tools to explain and defend their faith in various contexts.

Fifth, an increase in faith and certitude is a vital outcome of understanding Islamic beliefs. This growth in faith comes from not just knowing, but deeply understanding and internalizing the core tenets of Islam, which leads to greater trust and reliance on Allah.

Finally, the attainment of Closeness and Beholding refers to the deep spiritual connection and awareness that comes with profound knowledge of faith. As believers learn more about Allah and the principles of Islam, their relationship with the Divine becomes less superficial and more intimate. Closeness manifests as knowledge transforms into realization, and the pinnacle of this journey is to worship Allah with the awareness as if one beholds Him directly.

Al-Juwayni said (d. 1085), 'If one cannot comprehend first principles, they are not a thinking person.' He was a notable scholar and one of Imam al-Ghazali’s main teachers. 

He emphasized the importance of comprehending first principles, asserting that without this understanding, one is not fully engaging their intellect. Clarity in these principles leads to enhanced understanding, which in turn, increases faith and certitude. Ultimately, the closer a believer gets to Allah through learning, the more profound their faith becomes, culminating in a worship characterized by the awareness of Allah's omnipresence.
