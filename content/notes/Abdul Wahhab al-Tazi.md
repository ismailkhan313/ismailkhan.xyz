**Sidi Abul Mawahib Abdul Wahhab Al-Tazi Al-Fasi** (Arabic: سيدي عبد الوهاب التازي) is known as the _baraka_ (blessing) of Fes. He is said to have had the spiritual rank of _Ghawth_ for 34 years.  He was born and raised in the city, although his family originated from Taza in eastern Morocco. Among his teachers were the great Shaykh Abdul Aziz Al-Dabbagh and Mawlay Ahmad al-Siqilli.

The scholar and historian Muhammad ibn Jafar al-Kattani wrote about his relationship with Abdul Aziz Al-Dabbagh in _Salawat al-Anfas_:

> Among those that he had met in his beginnings is the Renowned Pole, Mawlana Abd al-Aziz al-Dabbagh (may Allah be pleased with him). He had been privileged to encounter him frequently, seek his blessing, take from him, and attain many acts of grace from him. One day, he met him in al-‘Aqba al-Zarqa in Fez. He kissed his hand and bowed his head down toward the earth in silence. The Shaykh said to him: ‘My son, Abd al-Wahhab,—for he was his son through breastfeeding; his wife breastfed him when he was young—do you want to see the Messenger ﷺ? ‘Yes,’ he replied. Then he said to him, ‘Raise your head and have a look!’ And there was the Messenger ﷺ and Abu Bakr al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) with him!

Sidi Abdul Wahab al-Tazi made the pilgrimage to Makkah in in 1753 (1166 AH). During his travels in Egypt, he was initiated into the Khalwatiyya order by Muhammad al-Hifni (d. 1767/1181) and Mahmud al-Kurdi (d. 1780/1186), both students of Mustafa al-Bakri (d. 1749/1162). He is also said to have been initiated into the Naqshbandi order whilst travelling in the East. He also headed the Khadiriya order which came from the Shadhili way through his Shaykh, Abdul Aziz Al-Dabbagh who is said to have received the tradition directly from al-Khidr.

One of the Shaykh’s foremost students was the gnostic Shaykh Ahmad ibn Idris. Sidi Abdul Wahab al-Tazi taught him the Khadiriya way and hadith over a period of four years.

Shaykh Abdul Wahab al-Tazi passed away either 27 Sha’ban 1206 / 20 April 1792 or 11 Safar 1213/25 July 1798. Mawlay Sulayman, the ruler of Morocco at the time, built a tomb for him in the Bab al-Futuh Cemetery. He is attributed to the popular prayer upon the Prophet ﷺ, [Salat al-Nariya](https://salawat.com/durood-nariya/) which is also known as Salat al-Taziya.
