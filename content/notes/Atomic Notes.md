The term "atomic notes" specifically suggests the idea of notes being the smallest, indivisible units of information that can be recombined and linked in various ways to support learning, creativity, and knowledge synthesis. This idea has been popularized more recently by advocates of digital note-taking and knowledge management systems, especially within communities that focus on tools like Obsidian.

> Atomic notes form the building blocks for a nimble, connected system of knowledge. The focus is on extracting the key details into standalone units. This practice makes it easier to link concepts and reuse ideas in new contexts.
> 
> - Focus on one idea per note
> - Strike a balance – don’t make notes too broad or too fragmented
> - Think of note titles as insight on how to use the content within
> - Each note handles its own discrete task

The concept of atomic notes, often associated with modern knowledge management practices, as far as I can tell, does not have a single inventor. Instead, it has evolved over time from various thinkers and methodologies. A notable influence on the idea of breaking down information into small, self-contained units can be traced back to the [Zettelkasten method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) developed by the German sociologist Niklas Luhmann. Luhmann's method involved creating individual notes, each capturing a single idea, which could then be linked together in a network to support complex thinking and writing.
 
The driving philosophy behind atomic notes aligns with principles from cognitive science and information theory, emphasizing that managing and understanding information in small, modular pieces can enhance comprehension, retention, and the ability to make connections between ideas.
