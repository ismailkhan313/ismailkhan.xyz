Aqidah and Kalam are terms used within Islamic theology, and while they are related, they refer to different aspects of the Muslim intellectual tradition. 

## Aqidah
*Aqidah* translates to belief, creed, or doctrine. It refers to the set of beliefs that constitute the core tenets of the Islamic faith. It encompasses the fundamental principles and doctrines that a Muslim must believe in, including the oneness of God (*tawhid*), the prophets, the scriptures, the angels, the Day of Judgment, and divine predestination (*qadar*).

Aqidah includes essential beliefs required for a Muslim's faith. 

These beliefs are generally straightforward and universal across various Islamic sects. 

Aqidah is taught extensively at the foundational level of Islamic education to ensure that every Muslim understands the basic tenets of the faith.

## Kalam
*Kalam* translated to theology. It refers to Islamic scholastic theology, a discipline that seeks to defend and rationalize Islamic beliefs using logical and philosophical arguments. It involves a deep examination of theological questions and the use of reason to understand and articulate the faith.

Kalam often tackles more complex and nuanced theological issues, such as the nature of God, free will versus predestination, and the attributes of God. 

It represents an intellectual tradition that has developed over centuries, especially within Sunni Islam, with prominent schools like the Ashâ€™ari and Maturidi. 

Kalam uses a dialectical method of reasoning and debate to address theological questions and to refute heresies and misconceptions.

While it originally relied on Quranic and Hadith sources, Kalam later incorporated and engaged with Greek philosophy and other intellectual traditions.
