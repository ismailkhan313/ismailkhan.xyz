Aqidah and Kalam are terms used within Islamic theology, and while they are related, they refer to different aspects of the Muslim intellectual tradition. 

## Aqidah

Aqidah translates to creed and represents the core tenets of Islamic faith, such as the oneness of God (tawhid), prophets, scriptures, angels, the Day of Judgment, and divine predestination (qadar). An example is the [[Creedal Points of Aqidah Tahawiyyah|Aqidah Tahawiyyah]] of Imam al-Tahawi. These beliefs are fundamental and usually universal across the Islamic traditions. Aqidah is taught at the foundational level of Islamic education to ensure understanding of these basic tenets.
## Kalam

*Kalam* or *ilm al-kalam* is the science that establishes and elaborates upon matters of doctrine and belief. It is the sub-science of defending the soundness of the positions of Ahlus Sunnah to deviant sects. If refutes doubts and attacks against Ahlus Sunnah. Thus, these scholars are professional debaters or polemics. The science devoted to the defence of the creed through rational arguments and refuting contrary beliefs upheld by deviant sects.

Most times, ilm al-kalam can be referred as 'ilm at-tawhid' or 'ilm usul al-din.' They are used interchangeably to refer to the same science. These include also include books of Islamic philosophy.

Ilm al-kalam also refers to Islamic scholastic theology, a discipline that seeks to defend and rationalize Islamic beliefs using logical and philosophical arguments. It involves a deep examination of theological questions and the use of reason to understand and articulate the faith.

Kalam often tackles more complex and nuanced theological issues, such as the nature of God, free will versus predestination, and the attributes of God. 

It represents an intellectual tradition that has developed over centuries, especially within Sunni Islam, with prominent schools like the Ashâ€™ari and Maturidi. 

Kalam uses a dialectical method of reasoning and debate to address theological questions and to refute heresies and misconceptions.
