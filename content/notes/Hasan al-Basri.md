Al-Hasan ibn Abi al-Hasan Yasar Abu Sa'id al-Basri (d. 110) was a prominent Imam of Basra, known for his profound knowledge, asceticism, and embodiment of the Prophet's Sunna. Born to a freedwoman of Umm Salama (the Prophet’s wife) and a freedman of Zayd ibn Thabit (the Prophet’s stepson), he was nursed by Umm Salama and blessed by Umar to become wise in religion and beloved by people. Umar made the supplication on him, "O Allah! Make him wise in the Religion and beloved to people."

He was one of the early formal Sufis, and was known for wearing a cloak of wool (suf) his entire life. 

He is considered from among the Salaf to be one of [[The Substitutes (Al-Abdal)]], to help Muslims through their spiritual presence, as supported by a narration from Anas about the earth always having forty such men for divine assistance.

> [!cite] Anas said that the Prophet said:
>  The earth will never lack forty men similar to the Friend of the Merciful [Prophet Ibrahim], and through them people receive rain and are given help. None of them dies except Allah substitutes another in his place.
>  
>  Qatada said: “We do not doubt that al-Hasan [al-Basri] is one of them.”
>  
>  *Mu'jam al-Aswat*, Tabarani.
