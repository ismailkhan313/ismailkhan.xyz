> [!cite] Ibn Ajiba's *The Book of Ascension to the Essential Truths of Sufism*
> Hope (raja) is the tranquility of a heart awaiting the object of its love, along with effort made to accomplish the means which lead to that object. Hope without effort is but vanity and self-deception.
> 
> For the generality of the faithful, hope is to reach the best of destinations as reward; for the elect, it is to attain God's pleasure (ridwan) and draw near; and for the elect of the elect, it is to attain stability in the consciousness of God and progress ever higher in knowledge of the mysteries of the worshiped Sovereign.
> 
> Fear and hope in the heart are like the two wings of a bird: it cannot fly except with both. However, it may be that hope is more prevalent with the gnostics (al-arifun) and fear with the virtuous (al-salihun).

The root r-j-w expresses the idea of hoping for something or expecting something. In various forms it occurs in the Quran about 30 times.
