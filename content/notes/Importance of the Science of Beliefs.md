Our ultimate purpose is to know how to attain your position in Paradise. The science of beliefs answers these ultimate purpose. Intelligence is the capacity to distinguish between matters. The benefit is to leave useless or non-consequential distinction. It's important to fulfill your purpose, and those with intelligence benefit from the science of beliefs that leads them directly there. 

> [!NOTE]
> Creedal beliefs are those things that the Prophets came with. 

The Prophets were given miracles to prove their truthfulness and affirm the beliefs the came with were from God to the rest of their community.

> [!NOTE]
> The science of beliefs is the formalization of the arguments of the Prophets. 

These arguments address the challenges either personal or collective against belief and certitude. All religious arguments stem from beliefs, and arguers come from within and without the religion. Such challenges are indirect or subtle questions about beliefs. Thus, the believers seek in-depth answers to relieve confusion.

> When creedal questions are answered correctly to the doubtful then inoculation occurs. Inoculation safeguards something by imbuing a protection over it. When this is accomplished the questioner increases their own faith while relieving others of their doubts.
