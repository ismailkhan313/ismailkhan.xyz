## Text Summary

*"A Detailing of the Two Creations and the Attainment of the Two Happinesses" (Tafs‘īl al-Nash’atayn wa Ta‘līl al-Sa‘ādatayn)* by Abu Al-Qasim Al-Hussein bin Muhammad Al-Mufaddal [[Al-Raghib Al-Isfahani]] is a short exploration into the essence of human existence and the purpose of life according to Islamic thought. This text now made accessible to the English-speaking audience through the translation efforts of Lamya Al-Khraisha, offers a short examination of the creation of humanity and the paths to achieving true happiness in both the earthly and eternal realms.

In this book, Al-Raghib Al-Asfahani, a renowned Islamic scholar, delves into the intricacies of human nature, the reasons for our creation, and the ultimate objectives that we are meant to fulfill. The text is structured to guide the reader through a fully thought out understanding of the human soul, its capabilities, and its destined journey towards perfection and divine contentment.

The Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre presents this work as part of its English Islam Series (Book Number 33), continuing its mission to disseminate key Islamic texts that contribute to the intellectual and spiritual enrichment of the global Muslim community. 

Abu Al-Qasim Al-Raghib Al-Isfahani states:

> This work, "The Detailing of the Two Creations and the Attainment of the Two Happinesses," addresses two key concepts:
> 
> 1. The Two Creations:
>    - The first creation is referenced in God's words: "For verily you have known the first creation, why then will you not remember?" (Al-Waqi‘ah, 56:62).
>    - The second creation, the Afterlife, is indicated in: "Then God will create the subsequent creation. Surely God is powerful to do everything." (Al-‘Ankabut, 29:20).
> 
> 2. The Two Happinesses:
>    - The first happiness is mentioned in: "Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you." (Al-Baqarah, 2:40).
>    - The second happiness is described in: "But as for those who [by virtue of their past deeds] will have been blest with happiness, [they shall live] in paradise, therein to abide as long as the heavens and the earth endure—unless your Sustainer wills it otherwise—as a gift unceasing." (Hud, 11:108).
> 
> This epistle was written for my honourable teacher, who sought to acquire the humanity that leads to the two happinesses. May God help him benefit from these teachings and achieve both happinesses, understanding their meanings and being mindful of their specifics.
