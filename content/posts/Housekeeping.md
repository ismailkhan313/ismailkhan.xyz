This post might be particularly useful for dedicated readers interested in how I publish my notes.

This site is effectively a [personal knowledge base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_base) (PKB) on Islamic studies and technology based upon a local [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault that I maintain. By utilizing the concept of [[Atomic Notes|atomic notes]] with [backlinking](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Backlinks) and [tagging](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Tags), when all else is working in cohesion, should provide deeper connections and quicker access to the broader concepts covered in this PKB. 

What this site considers the 'definition of Islam' or 'who is a Muslim' is aligned with the consensus views of with Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah or mainstream Sunni Islam. A good formal insight into this are the principles and declarations outlined in [The Amman Message](https://ammanmessage.com/the-three-points-of-the-amman-message-v-2/) issued in the early 2000s by authoritative Islamic scholars from eighty-four countries.

Generally, this space avoids using transliteration whenever possible since the effort of the busywork involved doesn’t justify the value, especially given the volume of notes I produce over time. However, should transliteration be used on a few notes the the [Brill Arabic-English transliteration system](https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/pages/help/transliteration-islam) will be used.

For Quran translations, [The Qur'an translated by M.A.S. Abdel Haleem](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-qur-an-9780199535958) is solely used. It’s accessible and coherent, making it suitable for a wide audience. Sticking to a single, well-regarded translation helps maintain full consistency throughout the site.

The typefaces on this site are all sourced via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). For body fonts, [Amiri](https://www.amirifont.org/) and [Sedan](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sedan) are used. Header fonts use [Cardo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cardo). Any code lines and blocks use [IBM Plex Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono).
