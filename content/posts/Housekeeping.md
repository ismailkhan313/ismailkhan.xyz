This post may benefit the enthusiatic or long-term reader in the approach I take to publish my notes. 

I use the Brill Arabic-English transliteration system. As a rule, I avoid using this as much as possible as it's 'busywork' that doesn't add tremendous value and takes up time.

I use the M.A.S. Abdul-Haleem Quran translation in my notes. No English translation is perfect, some translations have their own intentions and use cases, and all come with their baggages and problematic issues. But by using one translation in this space it serves the vision of consistency which I deem important.

I use the Amiri font that has a classic English typeface and is compatiblite as a traditional Arabic Naksh font.
