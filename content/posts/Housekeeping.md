This post might be particularly useful for dedicated readers interested in how I publish my notes.

This site is effectively a [personal knowledge base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_base) (PKB) on Islamic studies and technology based upon a local [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault that I maintain. By utilizing the concept of [[Atomic Notes|atomic notes]] with [backlinking](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Backlinks) and [tagging](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Tags), when all else is working in cohesion, should provide deeper connections and quicker access to the broader concepts covered in this PKB. 

When necessary, the [Brill Arabic-English transliteration system](https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/pages/help/transliteration-islam) is used. However, I generally avoid using transliteration whenever possible since the effort of the busywork involved doesn’t justify the value, especially given the volume of notes I produce over time.

For Quran translations, I rely on [The Qur'an translated by M.A.S. Abdel Haleem](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-qur-an-9780199535958). It’s accessible and coherent, making it suitable for a wide audience. Sticking to a single, well-regarded translation helps maintain the consistency I consider essential.

The [Amiri font](https://www.amirifont.org/) is used throughout this site as sourced via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). This typeface, inspired by the classical Naksh style, is ideal for long-form text in both English and Arabic. Its readability as a web font is the main reason for its selection.

Finally, some may need to know where I stand regarding the 'definition of Islam' or who I 'consider a Muslim.' My views align with Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah or mainstream Sunni Islam, and I consider someone a Muslim based on the principles and declarations outlined in [The Amman Message](https://ammanmessage.com/the-three-points-of-the-amman-message-v-2/) issued in the early 2000s by authoritative Islamic scholars from eighty-four countries.

If you spot any errors or have suggestions feel free to submit your revisions to ismailkhan.dev[at]gmail.com whereupon I will take a look, in sha Allah.
