2024 commences with a reading challenge that covers over 25 introductory books on Islam recommended and curated by [QuranicThought.com](https://quranicthought.com/) in Jordan, Amman. This organization is home to millions of Arabic Islamic manuscripts with the larger aim to collate every classical Arabic manuscript in the Islamic tradition, and provide supplementary notes and audio lectures. I find it to be a highly valuable resource for students, researchers, scholars, and teachers. The website states: “Our mission is to preserve Islamic Civilization by making all its jewels available to the whole world for free using the latest technology.”

The website further mentions the following:

> Because the religious sciences produced by Islamic Civilization are so vast, we have categorized them by main subject to make access easier: e.g., Qur’an (for listening); _tafsir; hadith, usul, seerah, ‘aqidah, fiqh; ihsan, falsafa,_ and so on. We have chosen a list of 25 books for the essential texts of all disciplines which all Muslims should know. Beyond that, however, we have made a special section for the 500 most influential books on Sunni Thought (according to the Royal Aal al-Bayt Institution’s seminal survey). Most people—even many scholars—will not read much more than 500 books (especially as these are long books) in their lifetimes so this should suffice as a roadmap for most people to read throughout their lives.

The [web page](https://www.quranicthought.com/25-introductory-books/) mentions 25 intro texts on Islam but it really outlines 31 texts, and this does not include counting each volume of a series as its own read which is the case for a few items in the list. And that is what I will consider, that all volumes in a series be included for the required reading. Some of these books and their series reads over thousands of pages long a while some are epistles or treatises that sit at 100 or less pages.

The aim here is to read the list in entirety and provide thoughts and reflections as the year goes on. At the end of the challenge, I will review the list in in totality and reflect what benefits it has brought to myself.
## Why This List?

1. Educational Value: Each book is a treasure trove of knowledge, offering insights into the history, culture, and beliefs of one of the world's largest religions.
2. Cultural Understanding: In a world where misconceptions about Islam are rampant, this challenge provides an authentic source of understanding and empathy.
3. Personal Growth: Engaging with these texts can be a transformative experience, offering spiritual, moral, and philosophical insights.
4. Traditional Perspectives: The selection includes works from various scholars, providing a well-rounded view of Islamic thought.
5. Historical Insights: Understanding the past is crucial to comprehending the present. These books offer historical context that is often missing in contemporary discussions about Islam.
