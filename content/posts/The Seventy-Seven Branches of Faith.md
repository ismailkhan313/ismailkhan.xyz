This book review offers an brief analysis of the English translation of a notable Islamic text, “The Seventy-Seven Branches of Faith.” Translated by Shaykh Abdal Hakim Murad and published by Quilliam Press, this version stands out for its brevity and clarity, encompassing around 70 pages. While acknowledging the existence of another translation, “Mukhtaṣar Shu'ab al-Īmān li'l-Bayhaqī - The Abridgement of the Branches of Faith” by Turath Publishing, which reads at around 200 pages, this review focuses exclusively on Shaykh Murad's translation, focusing on the conciseness of the abridgement as as primary contribution to the understanding of introductory Islamic theology for students. Whereas the text from Turath does indeed go into more detail in explanation of the author.

Among the numerous works of Imām Al-Bayhaqī, “The Branches of Faith” stands out. This extensive compilation, originally encompassing about six volumes, amalgamates Quranic verses, prophetic hadīths, and sayings of eminent early Muslims, structured under 77 headings.

This translation is derives from the compilation by Imām al-Qazwīnī, who utilized the extensive seminal work of Imām al-Bayhaqī. A renowned Islamic scholar from Central Asia, al-Bayhaqī was born in 994 CE and is celebrated for his many works, notably his comprehensive compilations and theological writings. Al-Qazwīnī, born in Tabrīz in 1255, effectively summarizes al-Bayhaqī's original work, particularly focusing on creating the headings of the seventy seventy branches of faith as mentioned in the original hadith of the Prophet Muḥammad (saw).

Al-Qazwīnī’s abridgement delves into diverse Islamic teachings and principles, underscoring the quintessence of faith in Islam, conducting oneself in belief, understanding the veres of the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Muḥammad (saw). It accentuates the Quran and Hadīth as fundamental to Islamic doctrine and ethics, as well as to the societal structure.

The work provides an exhaustive commentary on the hadīth of the Prophet Muḥammad, “Belief has seventy-odd branches,” as narrated on the authority of by Sayyiduna Abu Hurayra (ra):

> Faith has sixty-odd, or seventy-odd branches, the highest and best of which is to declare that there is no god but God, and the lowest of which is to remove something harmful from a road. Shyness, too, is a branch of Faith. (Al-Bukhari and Muslim)

Imām al-Qazwīnī elucidates the rationale behind the abridgement:

> After a long time and many oft-repeated requests, I obtained the book 'The Branches of Faith' by the Imam, the hadith master, the jurist, Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn Husayn al-Bayhaqī — which was in six volumes — in order to copy them as they were. However, I found them to be scattered throughout the text; they were not together in the prelude nor in the first volume. He had provided copious detail and discussion but had disseminated them throughout the whole text. Necessity demanded that I gather them into one compilation, making them concise and using them as headings for each topic. I have supported [the branch] by presenting a verse from the book of Allah as evidence, or an authentic hadith from the most authentic of what has been narrated from the Messenger of Allah. In some cases, when discussing some of the branches, an extra verse or two, or hadith, or words [of explanation], or an anecdote or two, or a couplet of poetry or two, were added which Bayhaqī did not mention [in his book]. He arranged it into seventy-seven chapters [based on the number of branches].

The work adeptly fulfills its intended purpose, offering a comprehensive understanding of Islamic teachings, principles, and the exemplary way of life of the Prophet of Islam (saw). It prioritizes practical aspects of Islam, underscoring the significance of knowledge, ethics, and the spiritual dimensions of faith. The text also serves as a foundational guide, pertinent and accessible to contemporary lifestyles, particularly for Muslim communities in the West.

Key indicators of the text’s efficacy include:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The text encapsulates a wide spectrum of topics under seventy-seven branches, offering an extensive overview of Islamic teachings.
2. **Practical Emphasis**: It foregrounds the practical application of Islamic principles in daily life, mirroring the “radiant and loving pattern of life” exemplified by the Blessed Prophet of Islam (saw).
3. **Spiritual and Ethical Dimensions**: The work emphasizes the spiritual and ethical facets of Islam, serving as a foundational guide for the religion.
4. **Accessibility and Relevance**: The text addresses the contemporary need for succinct, accessible faith manuals, especially for Western Muslim communities.
5. **Promotion of Practice and Knowledge**: It advocates the pursuit of authentic knowledge, the practice of virtues, and the remembrance of God.

For further study, it is recommended to explore the tafsīr (exegesis) of the Quranic verses and the commentary on the hadīths corresponding to each of the 77 branches.

Here is a short poem that captures the essence of Islamic faith and theology, likening it to a flourishing garden where each aspect of belief is a branch, teaching and nurturing the soul:

> In the garden of faith, where belief's branches sway,  
> Each leaf whispers wisdom, in night and in day.  
> Rooted deep in the heart, where the purest love lies,  
> The tree of theology under Allah's vast skies.
> 
> In each bough, a lesson, in each leaf, a tale,  
> Of Tawhid's oneness, where no heart can fail.  
> Like branches reaching up to the heavenly throne,  
> Faith binds the believer, never to be alone.
> 
> The roots of Iman, in five pillars entwined,  
> Shahada's declaration, in every heart enshrined.  
> Salah's leaves rustle with each bow and rise,  
> Zakat's fruits share bounty, generous and wise.
> 
> Sawm's branches, bare, teach the soul restraint,  
> While Hajj's path weaves through each believer's paint.  
> In this orchard, scholars like birds take flight,  
> Spreading seeds of knowledge, from dawn to night.
> 
> So walk the garden's path, with heart and with mind,  
> In faith's embracing arms, peace and purpose you'll find.  
> For in the tree of theology, with its branches wide,  
> Lies the beauty of Islam, forever to abide.

In conclusion, the text offers a short but enlightening journey through the intricate branches of Islamic faith. It expertly unravels the basics of the Islamic theology, weaving together Quranic verses and ahadith, scholarly insights, and the spiritual depth of its saints. The author’s skillful compilation brings to life the essence of Islamic teachings, providing readers with a profound understanding of its principles and practices.

This exploration into the rich tapestry of Islamic belief is not just educational, but also deeply moving. It encourages introspection and a greater appreciation for the diverse yet interconnected aspects of the faith. From the foundational pillars to the subtleties of spiritual interpretation, the book serves as a continous reference resource that students of Islam should keep in their library.
